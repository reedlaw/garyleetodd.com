The first lecture of 28 on Chinese History from its origins to the present,
given in 2007 by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History at Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. This was our first attempt
to make video recordings, and the presence of a camera proved somewhat
intimidating. I felt like a zombie during the lectures, and the students all
sat silently behind the camera, until after the camera was turned off. The
best discussions all took place after the lectures.
