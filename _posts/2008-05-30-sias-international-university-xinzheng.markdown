Sias University began in 1998. By 2010-2011 it had over 22,000 students, 14
classroom buildings, a dozen dormitories, a large indoor pool, and has been
acclaimed one of the 10 most beautiful campuses in China. The pagoda sits atop
the "tomb of the fisherman," dating back to the Warring States period over
2000 years ago. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of American & Chinese
