Xinzheng is the birthplace (c. 2700 BC) of semi-legendary Yellow Emperor
Huangdi, sometimes called the First Ancestor. In the Chunqui & Zhanguo eras it
was the capital of the states of Zheng and Han (770-230 BC), and features
probably the largest rammed-earth city wall remaining in the world. A 1923
discovery of a tomb of a King of Zheng (Zhengwang) from c. 575 BC led to the
birth of modern Chinese archaeology. In addition to a chariot burial, the tomb
contained the famous bronze "crane & lotus" urn, arguably the most exquisite
bronze vessel ever made. Two ancient towers from Northern Song and Ming
Dynasties dominate the riverside area downtown. Zheng-feng Park lies on the
river next to the campus of Sias International University. Photos by Gary L.
