Xi'an was the capital (or near the capital) of the W Zhou, Qin, W Han, Sui &
Tang dynasties. The Dayan (Big Wild Goose) Buddhist Pagoda & the Great Mosque
date from the Tang, while the city walls & bell & drum towers were built
during the Ming. Nearby is the tomb of First Emperor Qin Shihuang, guarded by
the army of terracotta warriors. I have separate albums for that and the
provincial museum. I have also included photos of Tang-style costumes & dance
performed for the tourist groups.Â Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
