Kaifeng was the capital of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127 AD) as well as
the Wei kingdom, 4 of the Five Dynasties, and the later part of the Jin. The
current palace was rebuilt in 1743 on the ruins of the ancient one. The Iron
Pagoda (named because brick tiles look like rusted iron) was built in 1049.
Xiangguo Monastery features a Buddha of 1048 arms carved from a single ginkgo
trunk in the 1700s. Baogong temple honors the N Song official Bao Zheng, noted
for his strict & impartial enforcement of the law. Millennium City recreates
the grandeur of the N Song. I have new separate albums for Iron Pagoda &
Xiangguo.Â Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
