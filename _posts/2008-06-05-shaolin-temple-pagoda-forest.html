Founded in 495 AD, Shaolin is where the Chan (Zen) school of Buddhism was born, along with the martial art of gongfu (kung fu). It was destroyed by a warlord in 1928, and rebuilt in the 1980s, inspired by the success of a Jet Li movie. The Forest of Pagodas consists of 246 pagodas housing the ashes of monks interred there from 791 to 1803 AD, plus one modern one for a monk who died in 2006. I think I've photographed them all during at least 5 visits. Photos by Gary L.
