Zhengzhou was the penultimate capital of the Shang Dynasty, c. 1400 BC, with a
portion of the original walls still standing. The capital was supposedly
transferred to Yin (Anyang) after a devastating flood of the Huanghe (Yellow
River). Today Zhengzhou is a major railway center. It was the site of a
massacre by the warlord Wu Peifu of striking railway workers on February 7
(Erqi), 1923. The Erqi Incident contributed to the radicalization of Chinese
workers. Recently a huge monument to First Ancestor Huangdi (the "Yellow
Emperor") & his rival/relative Yandi was built on the banks of the nearby
Yellow River. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
