I spent the summer of 1991 teaching in Chengdu. Some photos were taken then.
They are poor copies of slides which I intend to replace this summer (2011).
The rest were taken during Spring Festival in 2008. I have posted additional
albums from a 2010 visit to Chengdu, including the Provincial Museum, Dufu's
Cottage & Museum, and 3 albums from nearby Sanxingdui. Check the tag
"Chengdu." Chengdu was the ancient capital of Shu Han under Liu Bei (221-223
AD), made famous by the Sanguo Yanyi (Romance of the Three Kingdoms). The
giant statue of Chairman Mao sits in the center of town on the site of the
ancient palace.Â Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
