Forbidden City was started by Emperor Yongle (1403-1424) of the Ming Dynasty.
Emperors ruled from there until the Revolution of 1911. Drum & Bell Towers lie
directly north of the palace. Beihai Park is northwest & features a Tibetan-
style White Pagoda. Jingshan Park (Coal Hill), directly north of the palace,
was made from dirt removed to form the moat. The city wall dates to the early
Ming. Only the southeast corner remains. Photos are from 2007, 2006, & 1991.
The 1991 photos will be replaced when I make better copies. I have a separate
album for the Temple of Heaven, and another for 2008 & 2009 visits which
include the Palace Museum. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, China. [https://picasaweb.go
