This is my Forbidden City photo album of 2008 and 2009, taken after most of
the pre-Olympics renovation was finished. I've also included special exhibits
of the Palace Museum: artifacts of the Imperial concubines, artifacts from the
Last Emperor Aisin Gioro Puyi, National Treasures of the Qing Dynasty, and the
bronze, jade, and porcelain galleries. Earlier photos from 1991, 2006, and
2007 can be seen in another album at my website. Photos by Gary L. Todd,
Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan,
China. [http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ForbiddenCityPalaceMuseum](htt
