The Summer Palace was designed by Jesuits to look like the great European
palaces. It was built by Emperor Qianlong (1736-1795) and destroyed by the
British & French in 1860 during the Second Opium War. The ruins were left in
place as a reminder of western imperialism. During the regency of Empress
Dowager Cixi in the late 19th century, portions around Lake Kunming were
repaired and used by members of the court. The infamous Marble Pavilion was
repaired with funds which had been set aside to build a modern navy, and
contributed to defeat in 1894-95 at the hands of Japan. Contrary to popular
belief, Cixi was more a figurehead than the evil power behind the throne.
Highlights of the Summer Palace include the Marble Pavilion, Temple of the
Fragrance of Buddha and the Long Corridor. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
