The Temple of Heaven is where the Ming and Qing emperors performed the annual
sacrifice to insure an abundant harvest. Except for a few taken in 2006, these
photos were all taken during the National Week holiday celebration, on October
2, 2008. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com
