The first photos are of the Sacred Way leading to the Valley of the Thirteen
Tombs of the Ming emperors. The remaining photos are of Dingling, the tomb of
Emperor Wanli, the only one which has been excavated and opened to the public.
The Thirteen Tombs, about 45 km NW of Beijing, contains tombs of most Ming
emperors. They are the earliest tombs with still-standing top structures, and
have not been completely looted. Dingling, the tomb of Wanli (1573-1620), a
long-reigning but disastrous emperor, was scientifically excavated in the
1950s and is open to the public. Artifacts are from the museum at the Ding
tomb. All photos were taken on National Day, October 1, 2008, except the final
ones which were taken in 1991. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasa
