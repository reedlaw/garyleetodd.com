Tiananmen Square lies just south of the Forbidden City. On the north end is a
large portrait of Mao Zedong, who stood on that spot on October 1, 1949, and
announced the birth of the People's Republic of China. On the west side is the
Great Hall of the People, China's main government building. Opposite that is
the National Museum. I have another album showing a temporary exhibit while
the museum was undergoing renovation. Many more albums will follow when the
museum reopens. On the south end is Qianmen Gate. In the square itself is the
Monument to the Revolutionary Martyrs and the Mausoleum where the body of
Chairman Mao lies on public display. Near the "Maosoleum" are heroic statues
depicting workers, peasants, & soldiers building the socialist revolution.
