The terracotta army protected the tomb of First Emperor of China Qin Shihuang
(221-210 BC). Photos are from Pits 1, 2, & 3, and from the on-site museums.
Some 8000 soldiers have been discovered and 1000 excavated to date, with only
one found intact. Color faded within weeks of excavation, so work was halted
for years until the problem of color stabilization was solved. Archaeologists
have resumed work in Pit 1. The army was damaged in the wave of destruction at
the end of the Qin Dynasty.Â The high-resolution photos were taken in 2009 &
2011; the others in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [
