After 1929 peasants near Chengdu began finding jade artifacts. In 1986 two
burial pits full of bronze vessels, heads, masks, and trees were unearthed
nearby. The culture which produced them was contemporary with Yin (Shang
Dynasty) culture of Anyang, c. 1200 BC. Most likely they evolved into the
Jinsha Culture, and later the Ba-Shu culture. The museum features a number of
Ba-Shu and Dian artifacts. In early 2010 I went back and added two greatly
upgraded albums from Sanxingdui, though they no longer displayed the Ba-Shu
artifacts. Check the "Chengdu" tag to find them.Â Photos by Gary L. Todd,
