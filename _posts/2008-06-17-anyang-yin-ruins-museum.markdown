Anyang was the site of the last Shang (Yin) capital, for some 255 years. In
1899 the famous oracle bones were discovered there, confirming the historicity
of the last 9 of the Shang kings. Fu Hao, the consort of King Wu Ding, was
buried there c. 1200 BC. She is considered China's first female general, and
her tomb is the only intact Shang royal tomb discovered so far. Objects in the
tomb are reproductions, but the artifacts shown in the on-site museum are all
genuine. Other artifacts from Fu Hao are found in my albums from the Henan
Provincial Museum in Zhengzhou or the National Museum in Beijing. The chariot
burials are the earliest discovered in China. One can see the evidence for
human sacrifice in many of these pictures. I have posted another album
featuring the 10th century pagoda in downtown Anyang. Photos by Gary L. Todd,
