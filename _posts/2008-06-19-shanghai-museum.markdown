This is the first Chinese museum I ever photographed, two years before I
started this website. I have since added 8 or 9 additional albums of museum &
Shanghai photos taken in 2008 & 2010. You can find them using the "Shanghai"
tag on the website.Â Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
