This album contains many ancient Chinese coins and coin moulds, plus a
collection of coins from nations on the Silk Road. This is one of at least six
albums I've created for the different galleries of the museum. Check the
"Shanghai" tag to find the others.Â Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
