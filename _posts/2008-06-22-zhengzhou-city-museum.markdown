This museum features artifacts from the Neolithic and Bronze Ages of ancient
China. As with other Chinese museums, artifacts displayed here are all of
local origin. The items in this museum were excavated in and around Zhengzhou,
which was once the center of Chinese civilization. Photos by Gary L. Todd,
