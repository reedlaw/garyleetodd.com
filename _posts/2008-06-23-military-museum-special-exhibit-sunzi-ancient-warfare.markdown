This was a special exhibit held between July 23 and October 5, 2008, at the
Military (People's Liberation Army) Museum in Beijing. It features some of the
best artifacts relating to warfare in ancient times. I also have two
additional Military Museum photo albums dealing with Ancient Weapons and
Warfare, and Modern Weapons. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasa
