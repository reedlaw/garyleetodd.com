This is the museum with most of the great national treasures. Unfortunately,
it has been under renovation for the last several years, and is not scheduled
to open until 2010. These photos are from a small temporary exhibit they had
there in 2006, along with the wax museum in the same complex. When the museum
reopens I intend to make significant additions to this album. Photos by Gary
L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng,
