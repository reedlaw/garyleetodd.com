This is my personal collection of Chinese artifacts: mostly ancient bronze
weapons, mirrors, chariot parts, belthooks, and coins. I've included a few
artifacts from other ancient cultures of interest to me. These are mostly
common artifacts rather than the national treasures prominently displayed in
museums and books. I have 5 more albums dealing with coins. Photos by Gary L.
