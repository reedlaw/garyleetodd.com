Photos feature Yuntai shan (mountain), Jiyuan shan, and Chaya shan in north
central China. Jiyuan shan hosts an ancient Palace of Greeting built for a
visiting emperor. Monkey Mountain is named that for reasons which may be
apparent from the photos. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History,
Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [https://picasaweb.goog
