Sanya, on the southern tip of Hainan Island, is the site of China's only
subtropical beaches. Large numbers of Russian tourists frequent the beaches,
so most signs are in Russian. Westward along the coast lies Nanshan (South
Mountain) Culture Zone, a Buddhist theme-park with a 108-meter tall statue of
the 3-faced Boddhisattva Guanyin built out in the ocean. It is the second
tallest statue in the world. The site also contains the world's largest gold &
jade buddha statue. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â [https://picasaweb.google.co
