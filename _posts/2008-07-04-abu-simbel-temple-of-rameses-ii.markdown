These are photos of the great Temple of Rameses II built on the southern
border of Egypt during the New Kingdom. The entire temple was relocated 50
years ago to preserve it from the rising waters of Lake Nassar formed by the
Aswan Dam. I have created other albums for the Cairo Museum, Old Kingdom
sites, and other New Kingdom sites. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor
of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://pic
