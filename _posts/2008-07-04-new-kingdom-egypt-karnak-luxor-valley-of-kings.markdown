Here are some ancient Egypt sites dating from the New Kingdom: Temple of Amun
at Karnak, Luxor Temple, Temple of Queen Hatshepsut, and several tombs in the
Valley of the Kings. I have created other albums for the Cairo Museum, Old
Kingdom sites, and other New Kingdom sites. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Professor
