These are photos of ancient Egyptian sites dating from the 3rd & 4th Dynasties
of the Old Kingdom in Saqqara, Giza, & Memphis. They were taken shortly after
9-11, which explains the delightful absence of droves of tourists. I have
created separate albums for the Cairo Museum, Abu Simbel, & other New Kingdom
sites. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International
University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/E
