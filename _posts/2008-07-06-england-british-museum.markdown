Random photos of mostly ancient and medieval places in England from several
different visits, in 1993, 2000, and 2003. British Museum photos & other
London museums are in separate category under World Museums. Many of these are
poor quality copies of slides which I intend to fix this summer (2011) and
replace then.Â Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
