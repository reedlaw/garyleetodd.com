Castles, palaces and cathedrals from all over Germany, including Mad Ludwig's
Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria and the palace complex at Potsdam near
Berlin. Also Martin Luther's Wittenberg. They are from trips in 1993, 2000,
and 2001.Â These are copies of slides I took before I got a good digital
camera, but I plan to make better digital copies this summer (2011) and
replace most of these. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History,
