Random photos of places in Switzerland, mostly around Lake Luzern (Lucerne),
taken in 1993, 2000, or 2001. These are copies of slides I took before I got a
good digital camera, but I plan to make better copies this summer (2011) and
replace all these. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, China. [https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryL
