Random photos shot in France in 1993 and 2000. These are not-very-good copies
of slides, which I intend to replace this summer (2011) with much better ones.
I have a separate album for the Louvre. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, China. [https:/
