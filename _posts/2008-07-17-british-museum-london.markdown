This is one of the greatest museums of the world. The several times I visited
there were before I got the idea to make a serious photographic record of
historic artifacts, so this album scarcely does the BM justice. Check out
their own website. My photos are digital copies of prints or slides, so they
are not as good as my more recent photos. Several photos from the museum in
Edinburgh, Scotland, are included at the end. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [
