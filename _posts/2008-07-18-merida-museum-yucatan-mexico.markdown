This is a small regional museum dealing mostly with the Maya of the Yucatan.
But since the Maya wing was closed for renovation when I visited the INAH
Museum in Mexico City, this is about all I can do for the Maya culture,
arguably the most interesting of all the ancient Mesoamerican cultures. Photos
