The Louvre in Paris is one of the great universal museums of the world. It is
a former palace of French kings. I took most of these photos in 1993, before I
started doing serious museum photography. I took a few more in 2000. Photos by
Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University,
Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/LouvreParis](
