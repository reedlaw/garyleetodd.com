General Santos City on Mindanao is where Amy grew up and where I lived for a
year after we got married. We usually spend our winter break there every year
between semesters. Lots of beautiful tropical scenery in these photos, along
with some family places.Â Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History,
