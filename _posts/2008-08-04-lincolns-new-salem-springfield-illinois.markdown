During the Great Depression New Salem Village was reconstructed to the way it
appeared c. 1830 when Abraham Lincoln lived there. Historical reenactors add
to the feeling of authenticity. The Springfield sites include the only home
Lincoln ever owned (by this time he was a rich corporation lawyer), his law
office, the old state capitol, and his tomb. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
