By definition there was no "Civil War" in America. A civil war is when two
sides fight for control of one country. Historically accurate terms include
War Between the States, War for Southern Independence, or War of Northern
Aggression. As usual, the winners wrote the history, and in this case, named
the conflict. I have photographed numerous battlefields, and added a few
photos of other historically-relavant places like capitol buildings, homes of
leading personalities, tombs, monuments, and museums. Photos by Gary L. Todd,
