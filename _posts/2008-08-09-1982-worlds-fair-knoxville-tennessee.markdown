This was the first time that "Red China" exhibited in a World's Fair, and its
pavilion was arguably the highlight of the fair. I've been told the terracotta
warriors from the tomb of Qin Shihuang were, in fact, reproductions, but the
rest of the craftsmanship exhibited there was outstanding. The display of
circus miniatures was pretty impressive as well. Overall, the 1964-65 New York
World's Fair and Expo 67 in Montreal were bigger and more impressive. I have
recently added a new album of B&W photos from those fairs. Photos by Gary L.
