This reconstructed early 19th century fort on the north shore of Lake Superior
was the site of the annual rendezvous where fur trappers brought their pelts
down from the Rockies and traded them for their yearly supplies, and spent a
few weeks drinking and celebrating. Historical reenactors play the parts of
the people who actually lived there. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor
