These are mostly scenic photos of West Coast states: California, Oregon,
Washington, & Alaska. The faded photos date from 1976. The Alaska photos are
from a layover during a flight from China to America in 1991. I took the Mount
Saint Helen's photos just after learning my dad had passed away in 2000, so my
heart wasn't really into the photography then. My son Marcus was in Army
Language School in Monterey in 2006 when we visited there, and the Sequoia
National Forest photos were taken shortly afterward when we visited Amy's
cousin and her family. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History,
Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.googl
