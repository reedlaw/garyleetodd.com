These are mostly scenic photos of the Colorado Rockies. In the 1970s I worked
sometimes at a camp (Bear Trap Ranch) in the mountains near Colorado Springs.
Cripple Creek and Victor were old gold mining towns at a fairly high elevation
(nearly 3 km). Garden of the Gods has some pretty amazing rock formations.
