This is another great museum which I visited many times before I started
seriously taking photos. Someday I hope to return and do some serious picture-
taking there. In the meantime, I am posting all that I have. Photos by Gary L.
Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng,
Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/FieldMuseumOfNaturalHis
