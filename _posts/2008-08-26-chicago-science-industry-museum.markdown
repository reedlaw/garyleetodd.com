This museum features the U-505, the only German U-boat captured during World
War II. I also have some historic locomotives here, but so far have not been
able to locate the rest of my photos from the museum. I will add them if and
when I do. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com
