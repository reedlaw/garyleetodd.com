Col. Robert R. McCormick was publisher of the Chicago Tribune Newspaper.
During World War I he served as a colonel in the First Army Division, the "Big
Red One." He named his Wheaton, Illinois, estate Cantigny after the village in
France where his division saw much action. He built a museum depicting the
history of the First Army Division and created a foundation to make the museum
& estate free to the public after his death. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
