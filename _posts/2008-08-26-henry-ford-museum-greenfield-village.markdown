Henry Ford collected all sorts of things: automobiles, airplanes, household
appliances, industrial machines, houses & buildings. He admired Thomas Edison
and had Edison's entire Menlo Park laboratory shipped to Michigan. The museum
displays some of Ford's collections, while Greenfield Village is made up of
buildings he had shipped there from all over America and England. Photos by
