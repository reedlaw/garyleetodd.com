Part of the University of Chicago, this museum houses many artifacts from the
expeditions to the Ancient Near East and Egypt beginning in the 1920s. I have
included the museum's very helpful historical and descriptive plaques, so I
did not feel it necessary to add captions to this album. Photos by Gary L.
