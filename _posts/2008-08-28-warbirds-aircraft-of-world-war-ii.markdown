My dad was a P-47 fighter pilot in World War II (see first picture) and
aviation editor for the Rockford Newspapers, so I grew up around airplanes.
These are all WW II aircraft still in operation, many owned and flown by the
Confederate Air Force. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History,
Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.googl
