I took the first photos just after the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. The
Olympic displays were on Tiananmen Square, except for the two at the entrance
to the tomb of Emperor Wanli. I added photos from Kaifeng and from the Great
Wall. In November, 2009, I visited Olympic Park again and took the closeup
photos then. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com
