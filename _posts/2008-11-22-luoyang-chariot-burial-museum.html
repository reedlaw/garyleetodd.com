From 770 to 256 BC Luoyang was capital of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, although the Zhou king was little more than a figurehead or ceremonial leader. This royal tomb was discovered during excavation for a building project. It contains the first 6-horse chariot ever found in China, almost certainly the chariot of the Zhou king. Unlike the Xinzheng chariot burial where the wagons are thrown into a pit, these are all arranged in battle formation. The tomb itself lies beneath the chariots. Photos by Gary L.
