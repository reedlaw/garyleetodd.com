White Horse Temple (Baima si) is where tradition says Buddhism first took root
in China in the first century with sacred texts brought from India on two
white horses. At that time Luoyang was capital of the Eastern or Latter Han
Dynasty. Unfortunately, the pagoda was under repair when I visited on November
22, 2008, and was still under repair in June, 2010. I have included two photos
from an earlier visit in 2006. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasa
