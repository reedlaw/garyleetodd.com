Luoyang was the capital of the Eastern Zhou, Eastern Han, and secondary
capital of the Tang Dynasties. It is a rich source of ancient artifacts from
myriads of tombs found in the area. The city museum displays artifacts from a
long period of Chinese history. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
