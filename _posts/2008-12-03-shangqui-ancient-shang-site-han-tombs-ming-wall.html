When Liu Bang (Han Gaozu) founded the Han Dynasty he established commanderies to govern part of his empire, and kingdoms for his relatives and loyal supporters. Mangdang Mountain near Shangqui is the site of tombs belonging to the Han royal family which ruled the Liang Kingdom. Original tomb furnishing were looted in antiquity; ones shown here are reproductions. The jade burial suit actually excavated here is in the Henan Museum in Zhengzhou. The wall around the old city of Shangqui was built in 1511. The temple to Shang ancestors depicts the "Chinese business ancestor" and includes a Yuan Dynasty temple built on the site of the ancient Shang observatory. The other modern temple nearby is dedicated to the legendary discoveror of fire. The tomb itself was rebuilt in 2003 on the traditional site. Photos by Gary L.
