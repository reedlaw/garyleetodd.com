When Liu Bang (Han Gaozu) founded the Han Dynasty he established commanderies
to govern part of his empire, and kingdoms for his relatives and loyal
supporters. Mangdang Mountain near Shangqui is the site of tombs belonging to
the Han royal family which ruled the Liang Kingdom. Original tomb furnishing
were looted in antiquity; ones shown here are reproductions. The jade burial
suit actually excavated here is in the Henan Museum in Zhengzhou. The wall
around the old city of Shangqui was built in 1511. The temple to Shang
ancestors depicts the "Chinese business ancestor" and includes a Yuan Dynasty
temple built on the site of the ancient Shang observatory. The other modern
temple nearby is dedicated to the legendary discoveror of fire. The tomb
itself was rebuilt in 2003 on the traditional site. Photos by Gary L. Todd,
