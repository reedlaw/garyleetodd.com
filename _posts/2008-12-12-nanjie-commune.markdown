Communism in China today is as scarce as hen's teeth. The free market has
totally transformed China, leaving only symbols of the past. The closest thing
to communism I have found is the Nanjie Commune in Henan Province. It is
actually organized as on old-fashioned commune with each member receiving a
nominal allowance, plus free food & housing. A few members are engaged in
agriculture, but most work in the commune's 20 or so industries, which produce
beer, bricks, and a famous brand of noodles. Also tourism. People visit Nanjie
to see a model commune in action, and also a quite attractive greenhouse
exhibit. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
