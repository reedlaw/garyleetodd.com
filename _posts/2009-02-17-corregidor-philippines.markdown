The Spanish lit bonfires on this island to guide their galleons. When the
Americans took over the Philippines in 1898 they turned this rock into a
powerful fortress, which the Japanese severely damaged in 1941-42. The fall of
Corregidor marked the end of American military presence until their return in
1944-45. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
