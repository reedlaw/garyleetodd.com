This is the old walled Spanish city dating back to the 16th century, which
includes the Manila Cathedral and Fort Santiago. During the Pacific War it was
the final stronghold of the Japanese forces and was badly damaged in the
fighting for liberation. There is a small museum at the fort devoted to
personal items of Dr. Jose Rizal.Â Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
