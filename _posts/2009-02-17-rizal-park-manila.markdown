Rizal Park, next to the Intramuros, is also called the Lunetta. It was the
site of the execution by the Spanish of Philippine national hero Dr. Jose
Rizal. The execution scene is depicted in larger-than-life bronze statues.
Also displayed are the busts of twenty historic Filipino leaders who resisted
imperialism, starting with Lapu-Lapu, the chief of Mactan Island who killed
Magellan and delayed Spanish colonization for four decades. Photos by Gary L.
