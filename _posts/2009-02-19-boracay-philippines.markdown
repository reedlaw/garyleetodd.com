Boracay's white sand beach has been rated as one of the best beaches in the
world. Most people get there by flying to Caticlan and taking a small ferry to
Boracay Island. We circled the island about ten times while waiting to land;
hence, the nice aerial views. We also took a catamaran to nearby Crystal Cove
and all around Boracay, with several stops for snorkling at coral reefs.
