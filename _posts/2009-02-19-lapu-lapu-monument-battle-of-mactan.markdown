This is the site on Mactan Island near Cebu where Lapu-Lapu, the chief of the
island, repulsed the Spanish and killed Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. Magellan's
crew continued his circumnavigation of the globe, while the battle effectively
delayed the colonization of the Philippines for more than four decades. Photos
