This is my personal collection of Chinese coins from the beginning of
civilization through the Five Dynasties period, about a thousand years ago.
Four more coin albums have been posted. Most of these are quite common, and
wealthier collectors will have much better examples. But I included these
because they show the effects of aging and often lengthy burial. I welcome any
corrections, as I am not an expert in this area. The "S" number refers to the
number in the Schjoth standard catalog of Chinese coinage. Photos by Gary L.
