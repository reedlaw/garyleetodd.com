The coins pictured here are all from the Northern and Southern Song Dynasties.
The "S" number refers to the number in the Schjoth standard catalog of Chinese
coinage. This is followed by the emperor who issued the coin, his reign date,
and usually the particular reign title era in which the coin was issued.
Northern Song coins are particularly plentiful, cheap, and rarely faked.
