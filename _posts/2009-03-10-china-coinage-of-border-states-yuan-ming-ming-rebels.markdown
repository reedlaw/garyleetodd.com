These coins from my personal collection follow the Southern Song and continue
up to the Qing Dynasty. The "S" number refers to the number in the Schjoth
standard catalog of Chinese coinage. This is followed by the dynasty, the
emperor who issued the coin, his reign date, and sometimes the particular
reign title era in which the coin was issued. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
