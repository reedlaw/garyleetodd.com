These coins from my personal collection are from Qing Dynasty China, except
for several from Japan & Annam. The "S" number refers to the number in the
Schjoth standard catalog of Chinese coinage. Emperor Xianfeng issued many high
value coins to save copper during the Taiping Rebellion. Most of these do not
have a Schjoth catalog number. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
