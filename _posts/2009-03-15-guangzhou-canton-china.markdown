In March, 2009, I took these photos of Guangzhou (Canton), China, in Yuexiu
Park, Six Banyan Temple, and the Memorial Garden to the 5000 Revolutionary
Martyrs killed by the Nationalists in 1927 during the suppression of the
Guangzhou Commune. Yuexiu Park has a famous statue celebrating the legend of
five immortals who rode on goats to bring grain to Guangzhou and assure the
region's continued prosperity. The park also contains the remnants of the Ming
Dynasty city wall and a monument to revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen (Sun
Zhongshan). The tower in the Six Banyan Temple dates to the 11th century. See
my additional albums of the Tomb of the King of Nanyue, City Museum, and
special exhibition of porcelain pillow collection. Photos by Gary L. Todd,
