This collection of porcelain pillows was donated to Guangzhou by Hong Kong
industrialist Yeung Wing Tak & his wife. The collection of over 200 pillows
ranges from Tang through Yuan Dynasties, with most of them made during the
Song & Jin Dynasties. They are housed in the Museum of the King of Nanyue near
Yuexiu Park, Guangzhou. Poor lighting & long exposure time left some of these
images blurred. My apologies. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
