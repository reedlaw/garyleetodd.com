This tomb of the second king of the Nanyue Kingdom, Zhao Mo, was discovered in
1983 in Guangzhou. It dates from the 2nd century BC, in the Western Han
Dynasty. The tomb had never been looted, and yielded some 11,000 relics, the
most important of which are on display at the modern museum facility. A
porcelain pillow collection is also on display at this museum, and is posted
in another museum album on my website. Poor lighting & long exposure time left
some of these images blurred. My apologies. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
