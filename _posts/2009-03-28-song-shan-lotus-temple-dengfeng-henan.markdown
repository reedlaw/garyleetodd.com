On 3-28-2009 a group of foreign & Chinese teachers from Sias University took a
hike over Song Shan mountain near Shaolin Temple in Dengfeng. This was a real
hike over goat trails - not the typical tourist mountain "hike" over paved
walkways and stairs. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com
