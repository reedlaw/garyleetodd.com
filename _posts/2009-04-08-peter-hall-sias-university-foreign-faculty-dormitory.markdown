I believe that the Sias foreign faculty receive better food and housing than
any other foreigners in China. For proof I submit food photos taken from April
2 through April 8, 2009. They include most main courses, but not most of the
side dishes like bread, butter, jelly, peanut butter, salad, fruit, yogurt,
coffee, cocoa, etc. New dishes are constantly being added, and unpopular ones
replaced. Foreign teachers occasionally submit their favorite recipes, which
sometimes end up as regular menu items. Two years ago we had a full time
American chef, who introduced some of the more popular items which are still
on the menu. This photo album was created in part to allow feedback on the
menu. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International
University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/P
