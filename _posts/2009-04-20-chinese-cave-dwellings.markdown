Millions of peasants lived in cave homes cut into the sides of hills. Most lie
abandoned today, but I found one still occupied in a village near Luoyang, in
Henan Province. It belonged to a family which built it some 200 years ago. The
matriarch of the family lived into her 90s and was one of the last women with
bound feet. She died about two years ago. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
