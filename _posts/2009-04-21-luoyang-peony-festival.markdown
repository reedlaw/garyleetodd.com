The peony is the national flower, celebrated every year by a festival in
Luoyang. Departing from my usual practice of photographing artifacts and
historical stuff, I've created an album taken from several peony festivals in
Luoyang. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLe
