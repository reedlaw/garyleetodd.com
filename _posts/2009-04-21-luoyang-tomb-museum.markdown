This is a tomb of a Northern Wei emperor excavated at Luoyang. Nearby some 40
tombs from Henan Province have been reconstructed in a tomb museum. They span
over a thousand years from Western Han through N. Song dynasties. The
artifacts displayed inside the tombs, of course, are reproductions. Photos by
