Kunming was home of the Flying Tigers during WWII. Today it is a clean, modern
city with year-round spring climate. This album includes random shots from
around town, plus a visit to the city zoo. My main interest was the two
historical museums which are featured in separate photo albums. They both
contain fabulous bronze artifacts from the ancient Dian Culture. Photos by
