Kunming was the home of the ancient Dian Culture which produced unique and
spectacular bronze artifacts, some of which are displayed here. The bulk of
the Dian bronzes are in the Yunnan Provincial Museum. The City Museum also has
skeletons of some of Yunnan's rare and unusual dinosaurs, as well as a sutra
pillar and tomb markers from a Dali Kingdom temple of the Song Dynasty era
which once stood on the museum site. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor
