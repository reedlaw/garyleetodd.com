Yunnan was the home of the ancient bronze age Dian Kingdom which produced
unique and spectacular artifacts, the most important of which are displayed
here. Other artifacts are from the Kingdom of Dali which was contemporary with
the Song Dynasty. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
