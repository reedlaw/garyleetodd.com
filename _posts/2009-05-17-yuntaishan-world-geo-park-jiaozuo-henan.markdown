This is a May, 2009, visit to Yuntai Mountain. You can see photos from a 2005
visit included in my "Mountains of Central China" album. The antique autos
were in a restaurant inside the mountain park. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, China. [http://
