Nanjing has a long and fascinating history, some of which is showcased in this
and several other Nanjing photo albums on my website. When Zhu Yuanzhang
(Emperor Hongwu, 1368-1398) established the Ming Dynasty, he made Nanjing his
capital, built the city walls shown here, and built a palace which was later
destroyed. The view of Xuanwu Lake Park was taken from the pagoda at Jiming
Temple. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com
