I stumbled upon this museum by accident, but have always loved dinosaurs and
almost majored in paleontology in college. However, I guess I just don't have
enough faith to believe all the macroevolutionary dogma, especially after
seeing too many evolutionists get creamed in debates with creationists who
raised too many embarrassing questions. Some years ago the evolutionists
circulated letters among university faculty advising them to stop debating,
which tells me something about the quality of their "science." Photos by Gary
