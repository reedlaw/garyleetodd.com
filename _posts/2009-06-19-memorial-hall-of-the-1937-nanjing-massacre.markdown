This memorial commemorates the 300,000 or so victims of a 6-week rampage by
invading Japanese troops in Nanjing in 1937. Iris Chang's, _The Rape of
Nanking_, is an excellent popular account of this forgotten holocaust of WWII.
The museum contains many photos which have been published elsewhere, so I did
not copy them here. But I have strong sympathies for the Chinese victims of
this brutality, as members of my own mother's family perished in the Nazi
holocaust at Auschwitz. As with the Nanjing Massacre, there is a company of
fools who try to deny that this mass murder ever happened. Â Photos by Gary L.
