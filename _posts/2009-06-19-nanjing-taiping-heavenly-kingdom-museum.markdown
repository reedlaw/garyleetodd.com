Hong Xiuquan led perhaps the largest peasant uprising in history, from 1850 to
1864. Claiming to be a younger brother of Jesus, Hong established his Heavenly
Kingdom of Great Peace (Taiping Tianguo) in Nanjing. From there he sent armies
to try to conquer the Qing Dynasty and establish himself as emperor. This
quasi-Christian rebellion inspired numerous other uprisings, and left an
estimated 20 million dead in its wake. Foreigners generally opposed the
Taipings, in part because they outlawed opium and interfered with foreign
profits. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
