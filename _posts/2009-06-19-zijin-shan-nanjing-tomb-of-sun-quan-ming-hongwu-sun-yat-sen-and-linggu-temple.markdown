Zijin Shan, or Purple Mountain, lies on the edge of Nanjing. It is the burial
place of Sun Quan, the king of Wu during the 3rd century Three Kingdoms
Period, and of Zhu Yuanzhang, the first Ming Emperor (Hongwu). It houses the
mausoleum of Dr. Sun Zhongshan (Sun Yat-sen), founder of the Guomindong and of
modern China, and Linggu Temple and Pagoda. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
