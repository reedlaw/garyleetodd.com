The Michael C. Carlos Museum is one of the best-kept secrets of great museum collections, although it did gain some fame recently for returning an important pharaonic mummy to Egypt. The collection is housed at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. It has 5 main galleries of ancient artifacts which I have photographed and placed into 4 albums on my website. Three are from July, 2009; the fourth was added July, 2010. Photos by Gary L.
