The Michael C. Carlos Museum is one of the best-kept secrets of great museum
collections, although it did gain some fame recently for returning an
important pharaonic mummy to Egypt. The collection is housed at Emory
University in Atlanta, Georgia. It has 5 main galleries of ancient artifacts
which I have photographed and placed into 4 albums on my website. Three are
from July, 2009; the fourth was added July, 2010. Photos by Gary L. Todd,
