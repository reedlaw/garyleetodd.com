This album contains photos of much of the Asian collections of Charles Freer
and Arthur Sackler. Most artifacts were acquired during China's Republican
era. I photographed them in July, 2009, although there are a few bronzes I
photographed in 2002. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History,
Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.googl
