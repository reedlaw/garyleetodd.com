These photos were all taken in 2009 unless otherwise noted. I took a few in
the 1990s, in 1978, and in 1961, before the Air & Space Museum was built. I
have also included photos from the Udvar-Hazy Air & Space Annex at Dulles
Airport. Several photos are without labels. I would welcome correct
information & corrections. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasa
