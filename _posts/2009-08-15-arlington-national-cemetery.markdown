This is the United States National Cemetery at Arlington, Virginia, located
just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., on land stolen from the
Robert E. Lee family during the War Between the States. The Washington, D.C.
photos are listed in a separate album under United States Historic Sites. The
Smithsonian Institution photos are in six separate albums listed under United
States Museums. Unless otherwise noted, the photos were taken in July, 2009.
