The Smithsonian Institution is one of the world's greatest museums - actually
about 15 or so museums. These are photos of the original building - the
"castle" - as well as from the new Museum of the American Indian and some
miscellaneous photos. I have posted separate albums for the Freer-Sackler
Chinese galleries, Western Cultures, American History, Natural History, and
Air & Space Museums. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com
