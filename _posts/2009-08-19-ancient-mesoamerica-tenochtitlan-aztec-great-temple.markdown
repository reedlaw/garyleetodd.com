Tenochtitlan was the capital of the Colhua Mexica (Aztecs) and was destroyed
by Hernan Cortez & his Tlaxcalan allies in 1521. The Templo Major (Great
Temple) was the site of thousands of human sacrifices to the war god
Huitzilopochtli and rain god Tlaloc. Buried for centuries, it was rediscovered
in the 1980s. Other photos of Aztec artifacts are in my INAH Museum album.
