Teotihuacan (c. 200 BC - c. 600 AD) was once one of the largest cities in the
world. It was given its name "City of the Gods" by the later Colhua Mexica
(Aztecs), whose emperors made frequent pilgrimages. El Tajin was contemporary
and perhaps related. It is located near Veracruz. Neither culture left a
written history. I took the photos in spring, 2001. Photos by Gary L. Todd,
