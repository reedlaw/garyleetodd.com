Tikal flourished in the Peten region of Guatemala from before 300 AD until
nearly 900 AD when it was abandoned. It was possibly the greatest of all the
Maya cities of the Classic Age, with a rich history recorded on stone
monuments. Yaxha lies about 30 km from Tikal, but remains largely unexcavated,
and has little known history. I took these photos in spring 2002. Photos by
