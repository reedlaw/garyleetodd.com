Kabah, Labna, Sayil, & Xlapak lie in the Puuc Hills of Yucatan, near Uxmal.
They bear a distinct and highly ornate architecture called Puuc Style. These
Post-Classic sites are small and close to each other. Edzna & Oxkintok are
probably transitional from Classic to Post-Classic, and lie a little farther
south. None of these sites has a recorded history. I took the photos in
winter, 2002. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
