Mayapan has been called the last "capital" of the Maya, following the downfall
of Chichen Itza. Buildings are of much poorer quality. It lasted less than a
century and collapsed before the arrival of the Spanish. Tulum is a small,
walled site, on the coast. Columbus probably saw lights from there when he
passed by in 1502. The site was abandoned shortly afterward. El Rey is a late
Maya village near Cancun. I took the photos in winter, 2001, except the
Mayapan photos which I took in 2002. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor
