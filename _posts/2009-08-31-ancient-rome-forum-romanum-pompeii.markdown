These are photos of the Forum Romanum, the heart of the Roman Republic and the
later Empire. The Colosseum is next to the Roman Forum. Pompeii was a Roman
seaport buried by a volcanic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 AD and preserved
through the centuries. I took the photos in summer 2000. Photos by Gary L.
