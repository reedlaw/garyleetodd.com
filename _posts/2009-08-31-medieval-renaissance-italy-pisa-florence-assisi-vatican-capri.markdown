These are photos of several important medieval and Renaissance cities in
Italy, along with scenic Serento and the neighboring Island of Capri with its
famous grottos. I also have a separate album for ancient Rome and Pompeii. I
took the photos in summer 2000. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasa
