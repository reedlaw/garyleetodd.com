The Bishop Museum deals with early Hawaiian history. Pearl Harbor, site of a
major U.S. naval base, is famous for the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941,
which brought the U.S. into the Pacific War. Iolani Palace was the palace of
the last Hawaiian kings & queen, until the U.S. took over in the 1890s. These
are all located in Honolulu, the capital of the islands. I took the photos in
2000 & 2003. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com
