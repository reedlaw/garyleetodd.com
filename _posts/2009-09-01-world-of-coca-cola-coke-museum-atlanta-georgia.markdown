This is a little different from the museums I typically photograph. Coca-Cola
was invented in Atlanta, Georgia, and that is where I lived before going to
China. Lots of these photos have my wife Amy in them. I took them in summer of
2009. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International
University, Xinzheng, China. [https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/WorldOf
