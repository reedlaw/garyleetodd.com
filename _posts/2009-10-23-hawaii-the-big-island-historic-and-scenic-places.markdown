These photos were all taken on the Big Island of Hawaii, mostly showing
historic religious and political sites. I also have photos of a recent lava
flow and up-close shots of whales. I took the photos in 2003. I have
additional albums for Oahu and Kauai. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor
of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://pic
