These photos were all taken on the "Garden Island" of Kauai, mostly showing
beautiful scenery. Many were taken from a helicopter. Some of these sites
should be familiar, as they were featured in a number of movies and television
shows. I took the photos in 2000. I have additional albums for Oahu and
Hawaii, the "Big Island." These albums show more historic places, and can be
found in the United States Historic Sites category. Photos by Gary L. Todd,
