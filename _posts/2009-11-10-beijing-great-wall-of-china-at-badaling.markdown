The Great Wall of China is credited to First Emperor Qin Shihuang (221-210
BC), who actually connected various local walls built by warring states over
the previous 500 years. They were originally made of rammed earth. Over 1000
km of it was rebuilt to its present condition in the Ming Dynasty, c. 1500s,
in the face of a Mongol threat. Unfortunately, much of it has fallen into
disrepair again. These photos were all taken at Badaling in 2011, 2009, 2006,
and 1991. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com
