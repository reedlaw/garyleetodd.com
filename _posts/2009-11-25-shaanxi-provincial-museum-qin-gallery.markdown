This is the Qin State Gallery of the Shaanxi Provincial Museum in Xi'an, taken
in fall, 2009, following major renovation. I have an earlier album of photos
from this museum, and have posted further albums of the other galleries. These
are all high-resolution photos taken with a 15+ megapixul Canon. Photos by
Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University,
Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ShaanxiProvin
