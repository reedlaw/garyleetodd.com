This is the Han Dynasty (and following) Gallery of the Shaanxi Provincial
Museum in Xi'an, taken in fall, 2009, following major renovation. I have an
earlier album of photos from this museum, and have posted further albums of
the other galleries. These are all high-resolution photos taken with a 15+
megapixul Canon. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com
