This is the Tang Dynasty (and following) Gallery of the Shaanxi Provincial
Museum in Xi'an, taken in fall, 2009, following major renovation. I have an
earlier album of photos from this museum, and have posted further albums of
the other galleries. These are all high-resolution photos taken with a 15+
megapixul Canon. Unfortunately, I ran out of time before I could write down
the information on all the artifacts in this gallery, so after the buddha
statues, I am doing a lot of guessing. Corrections are always welcomed. Photos
