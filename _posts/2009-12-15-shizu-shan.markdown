Shizu Shan is a mountain near Xinzheng with a 5000-year history and a
spectacular view. On clear days we can see it from our dormitory. I finally
climbed it in August, 2009. It had more steps than anything I have ever seen
in my entire life. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
