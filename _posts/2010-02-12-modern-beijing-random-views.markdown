I have many other albums of historic Beijing. This album is made up mostly of
modern parts of Beijing which don't fit in any of my other categories. Beijing
is an incredible city, and these photos hardly do it justice. I got the train
photos while stranded on the remnants of the Ming Dynasty City Wall waiting
out the rain. China has an excellent railway system. Photos by Gary L. Todd,
Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan,
China. [http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/ModernBeijingRandomViews](http
