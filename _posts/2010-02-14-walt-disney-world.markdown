This is Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, Epcot Center, and Disney Studios in
Orlando, Florida, taken in summer, 2009, unless otherwise noted. Amy Todd
appears in many of these. I have added digital copies of older photos from
visits in the 1980s & 1990s, along with a few from Disneyland California in
1976. Photos from Hong Kong Disney appear in my Hong Kong album. Photos by
Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University,
Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/WaltDisneyWor
