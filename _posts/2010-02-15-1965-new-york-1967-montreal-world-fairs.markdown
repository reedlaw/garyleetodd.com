In 1965 the Rockford West High School symphony orchestra played concerts in
the New York State Pavilion at the World's Fair, in Rockefeller Plaza in
downtown New York, and on the steps of the Capitol Building in Washington,
D.C. These are BW photos I took during that trip. I played trumpet. In 1967 I
rented a flat in Montreal and spent a week at Expo 67. Photos by Gary L. Todd,
