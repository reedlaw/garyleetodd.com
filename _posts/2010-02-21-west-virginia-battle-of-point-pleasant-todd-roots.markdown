My grandfather, Cecil Amos Todd, was born in Red House, West Virginia, in
1890. I've included photos I took in Red House many years ago, plus a 1947
family photo I copied. James Todd, my great-great-great-great grandfather, was
one of the Virginia Militia who fought at Point Pleasant, and whose name
appears on the monument. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History,
Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.googl
