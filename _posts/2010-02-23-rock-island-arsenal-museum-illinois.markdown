I took the Rock Island photos c. 1961 with a Brownie Bulls-eye camera & 620 BW
film. This is the John M. Browning Museum at Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois
near the Mississippi River. The others were taken at various time & various
places. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â [https://picasaweb.google.co
