In the 1980s and early 90s I lived in Illinois, where there are many
railroads. In my spare time I photographed quite a few of them. I am adding
all my photos to my website in 5 different albums. This one is for my
favorite, the Illinois Central RR, along with the Gulf, Mobile, & Ohio, and
the post-merger Illinois Central Gulf. I took most of these photos in the late
1980s along the ICG mainline between the Champaign ICG Yard and Tolono, unless
otherwise noted. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â [https://picasaweb.google.co
