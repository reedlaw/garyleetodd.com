In the 1980s and early 90s I lived in Illinois, where there are many
railroads. In my spare time I photographed quite a few of them. I am adding
all my photos to my website in 5 different albums. This one is for mid-size
railroads, mostly from the Midwest, as well as various short lines. The
Illinois Central will be in its own album. All locations are in Illinois
unless otherwise noted. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History,
Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â [https://picasaweb.goog
