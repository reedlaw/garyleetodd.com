I'm somewhat of a closet railfan who grew up along the Illinois Central RR and
rode the ICRR to and from the University of Illinois in the late 60s. These
are copies of photos I took at several RR museums in the U.S. & Britain,
mostly in the 1980s & early 90s, except for the one in England, which I took
in 2003. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com
