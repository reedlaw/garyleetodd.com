From 1975 to 1979 I lived in Duluth, Minnesota, overlooking the entrance to
the Duluth Ship Canal. It was easy to photograph the ships entering the
harbor. The Duluth photos were all taken from 1976 to 1979. The earliest
photos were taken with a half-frame camera. The prints were not very good
quality, so the digital copies are also not so good. I have added a few river
barges, as well as English Channel and Rhine River shipping. Photos by Gary L.
Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng,
Henan, China.
