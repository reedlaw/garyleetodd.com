This album deals exclusively with modern weapons. I have two separate albums
for ancient weapons in the Military Museum. There are quite a few U.S. weapons
on display here, so I'm listing this album under both "United States Museums"
and "Chinese Museums." Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History,
Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. Â [http://picasaweb.goog
