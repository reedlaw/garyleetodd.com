This is my 2008 album with some new or improved photos added in 2010, and with
the modern weapons removed to a separate album. In addition to the Modern
Weapons album, I have another album from a special exhibit on Sunzi and
Weapons in Ancient China. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History,
Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. Â [http://picasaweb.goog
