Guo State existed in western Henan during Western Zhou and early Spring &
Autumn periods. The tombs of the king and his consort, discovered in 1990,
were rich in bronze & jade artifacts, and contained a large chariot burial.
Guo State ended with the conquest by Jin in 655 BC. I've uploaded the full
resolution of the bronze artifacts and chariots, but the rest I uploaded at a
lower level. Poor lighting and/or thick glass made photography of the jade
very difficult. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. Â [http://picasaweb.google.co
