Xinzheng (where I have been living the last 5 years) is the birthplace of
Huangdi and the type site for the Peiligang Culture. The artifacts from the
tomb of the King of Zheng, discovered in 1923, formed the basis for the Henan
Provincial Museum in Zhengzhou, and led to the birth of both modern Chinese
museums & modern Chinese archaeology. The bronze in this museum is all Eastern
Zhou. The stone & pottery which I labelled Neolithic is probably Peiligang
Culture, and perhaps Yangshao, but I forgot to check the labels. I have
additional albums featuring Xinzheng historic sites and the Henan Provincial
Museum. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
