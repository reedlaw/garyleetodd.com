Nanwan Lake near Xinyang City in southern Henan was created by a huge dam
built in the 1950s. Jigongshan (Rooster Mountain) summer resort has over 200
villas built in many international styles of architecture. Jiang Jieshi
(Chiang Kai-shek) built a bunker command center here during one of his
encirclement campaigns against the Communists in the early 1930s. His wife
Soong Meiling used the nearby dance hall. Unfortunately, I missed most of the
beautiful scenery because of heavy fog. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
