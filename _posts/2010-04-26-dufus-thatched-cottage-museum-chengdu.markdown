Dufu was an 8th century Tang Dynasty poet who lived 4 years in Chengdu while
fleeing from the An Lushan Rebellion in the north. He built a thatched cottage
and wrote many poems at a site which has been honored continuously to the
present. In 1991 I visited the traditional site of the cottage. In 2001
workers discovered the foundations of Tang-era dwellings and recovered many
artifacts which are now on display in a new museum, just a short distance from
the traditional site. I've included displays and text which should provide
more information about his life. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
