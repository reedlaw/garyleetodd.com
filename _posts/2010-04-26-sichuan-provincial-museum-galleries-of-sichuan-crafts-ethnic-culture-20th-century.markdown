This is one of five albums from this museum. I've combined three galleries:
Gallery of Sichuan Crafts, Sichuan Ethnic Culture, and Sichuan in the
Twentieth Century. The latter features items from the Long March, which passed
through Sichuan in the 1930s. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China[http://picasawe
