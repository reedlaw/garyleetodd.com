This is one of five albums from this museum. It deals with ancient bronze from
Sichuan Province. Artifacts listed as Warring States are from the Ba-Shu
Culture. Because bronze is my own area of special interest, and because I want
to better show the results of aging, I have uploaded this album with full
resolution. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
