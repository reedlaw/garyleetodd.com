Kaifeng was the capital of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127 AD), and this
pagoda was built during that time. It got its name because its bricks have the
color of rusted iron. I recently revisited the temple and photographed many of
these bricks as works of art. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
