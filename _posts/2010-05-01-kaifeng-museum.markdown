Kaifeng was once the capital of Henan Province, and this was once the
provincial museum. It still has a good collection of artifacts through the
ages. However, the Kaifeng Jews exhibit on the 4th floor cost 50rmb and
contained two illegible stones and a stone pot. That's all. And when we
complained we had been robbed, the manager refused to refund our money. There
is another private museum dedicated to the Kaifeng Jewish community which is
much better. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
