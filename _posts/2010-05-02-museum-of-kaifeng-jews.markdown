A Jewish community has existed in Kaifeng for over a thousand years (some
sources say over 2000 years). The Kaifeng Jews exhibit on the 4th floor of the
Kaifeng City Museum cost 50rmb and contained two illegible stones and a stone
pot. That's all. And I was not able to take photos. You may learn more about
Kaifeng Jews at WWW.SINO-JUDAIC.ORG. The museum I show here is the private Shi
Family Mini-Jewish Museum on Chinese Jews of Kaifeng. It can be reached at
www.jewishchinatours.com. The family who runs it are direct descendants of the
ancient Kaifeng Jewish community. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
