Sanxingdui, near Chengdu, was an ancient city contemporary with the Shang
Dynasty at Yin (Anyang), but with an art style unlike anything else in the
world. Very likely the site was abandoned due to flooding, and the people
moved south to Chengdu, where they became the ancestors of the Ba-Shu people
of the Warring States era. I have a separate album for the bronze gallery,
plus an album I took two years ago which has many Ba-Shu weapons not on
display in 2010. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
