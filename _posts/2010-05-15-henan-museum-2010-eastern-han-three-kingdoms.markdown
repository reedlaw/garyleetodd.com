This was a special exhibit on Heroes of Ancient China, focusing on the Three
Kingdoms era. All artifacts are from Eastern Han and Three Kingdoms. The
bronze cavalry and chariots are the first originals I have been able to
photograph. In addition to 8 museum albums from 2010, I have 3 earlier albums
from this museum. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.[http://picasaweb.google.com/
