Yue Fei was a general in the Song Dynasty noted for his great loyalty and his
refusal to give up north China to the Jurchen Jin. To buy peace with the Jin,
Song Chinese officials treacherously murdered him. Today he is highly revered
as a true patriot. This is his memorial temple near Anyang. Photos by Gary L.
