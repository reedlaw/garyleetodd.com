These are photos from several temples and historic sites around Dengfeng,
excluding Shaolin Temple and the Yuan Observatory, which are in separate
albums. Most major temples are mainly for tourists, but I have a couple here
which are off the beaten path. The pagoda of the Songyue Temple was built in
the Northern Wei Dynasty, about 1400 years ago. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [
