Yuan Shikai was the general at the end of the Qing Dynasty who negotiated the
abdication of the last Manchu emperor. He served as President of the Chinese
Republic from 1912 to 1916, but attempted to create a new dynasty with himself
as emperor. This is his tomb in Anyang, built in the style of Ming and Qing
Imperial tombs. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
