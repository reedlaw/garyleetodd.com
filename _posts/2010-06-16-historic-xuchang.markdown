Xuchang has a long history and played a prominent role in the Three Kingdoms
era, serving as the de facto capital of Cao Cao after 196 AD, and capital of
the state of Wei in 220 until the capital was moved to Luoyang in the 220s.
Baling Qiao is the site of the bridge where the great general Guan Yu bade
farewell to the Prime Minister Cao Cao. He is honored with a temple there.
Guan Yu resided at Chunqiu Lou where he studied the Spring & Autumn Annals of
Confucius. The Wenming Temple Pagoda dates to the Ming Dynasty and stands 52
meters tall.Â Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
