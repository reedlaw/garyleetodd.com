Shanshan was a commercial center near Nanyang where merchants from neighboring
provinces exchanged goods and worshiped the god of business (Guan Yu). It was
built in the mid-18th century and operated throughout much of the Qing
Dynasty. Most of the amazing architecture is original. Photos by Gary L. Todd,
