Nanyang is a beautiful modern city in southern Henan with a rich history.
Historic sites featured in this album include: Wolong Hill, where Zhuge Liang
farmed the land and Liu Bei visited him three times entreating him to serve as
his military advisor at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty; an ancient
prefectural administrative office first built in 1271, which served as the
site of local government during the Yuan, Ming, & Qing Dynasties, the
Republican Era, and up to the beginning of the People's Republic of China; the
memorial hall of the sage of medicine; and Wang Fu Shan, the rockery and
temple belonging to the palace of the 23rd son of the first Ming emperor, Zhu
Yuanzhang (Hongwu). Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
