Oil baron J. Paul Getty built this villa near Los Angeles based on a Roman
villa buried in the 79 AD eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. It houses his personal
collection of antiquities collected from ancient Etruria, Greece, and Rome.
Most pictures of artifacts are preceded by a museum label describing the
artifact in greater detail. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasa
