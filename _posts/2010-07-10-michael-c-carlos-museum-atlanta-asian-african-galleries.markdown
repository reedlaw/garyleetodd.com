The Michael C. Carlos Museum is housed at Emory University in Atlanta,
Georgia. It has 5 main galleries of ancient artifacts which I have
photographed and placed into 4 albums on my website. Three are from July,
2009; the fourth was added July, 2010. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [
