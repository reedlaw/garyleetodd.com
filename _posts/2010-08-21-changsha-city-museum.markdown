The Changsha City Museum features artifacts from the city's 3000-year history.
Hunan Province's most famous resident was Chairman Mao Zedong, though the city
was also prominent during the Taiping Uprising in the 1850s. Most of the
ancient city was destroyed either at that time, or during the anti-Japanese
War. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International
University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/C
