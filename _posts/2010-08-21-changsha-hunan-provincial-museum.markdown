Hunan Provincial Museum has a great collection of ancient Shang and Western
Zhou bronzes. One gallery features the ten greatest archaeological discoveries
of Hunan Province, several of which are among the greatest discoveries in the
world. The museum's greatest treasures are the over 3000 cultural artifacts
excavated from the three Mawangdui Tombs of the Han Dynasty. Because it its
great significance, I have placed this gallery in a separate album. Photos by
