Here are views of Shanghai from the top 2 levels of the Oriental Pearl Tower
taken on Sept. 18, 2010. At the bottom of the tower is a museum of Old
Shanghai showing scenes from the late 19th & early 20th centuries, when it was
under the control of Western adventurers. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
