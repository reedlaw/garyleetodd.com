This is my fourth world's fair (I have photos from the other 3 posted
elsewhere on my website). I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. I was
there for only one day, so there is quite a bit I did not get to see or
photograph. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com
