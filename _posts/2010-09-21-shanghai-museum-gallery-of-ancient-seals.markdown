This album contains the gallery of ancient seals of the Shanghai Museum. Most
of them are quite small, and are generally placed in chronological order. This
is one of at least six albums I've created for the different galleries of the
museum. Check the "Shanghai" tag to find the others, or look for postings from
August, 2008. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com
