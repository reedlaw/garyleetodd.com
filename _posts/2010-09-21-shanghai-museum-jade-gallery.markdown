This album contains the jade gallery of the Shanghai Museum. Unfortunately,
harsh museum lighting makes jade the most difficult artifact to photograph,
and many of these shots are not very good. Hopefully they will give an idea of
the quality of workmanship anyway. Also, not every object here is true jade,
but I didn't have time to write everything down, so I will call it all jade.
This is one of at least six albums I've created for the different galleries of
the museum. Check the "Shanghai" tag to find the others, or look for postings
from August, 2008. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasaweb.google.com
