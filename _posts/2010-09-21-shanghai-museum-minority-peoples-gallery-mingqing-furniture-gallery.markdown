This album contains two galleries - the Gallery of Minority Peoples and the
Gallery of Ming & Qing Furniture. I took them just before closing, so they are
not complete and I didn't get the labels. But at least you can get the general
idea. This is one of at least six albums I've created for the different
galleries of the museum. Check the "Shanghai" tag to find the others, or look
for postings from August, 2008. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasa
