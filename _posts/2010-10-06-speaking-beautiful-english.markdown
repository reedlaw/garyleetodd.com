Why another book on how to learn English? That’s a great question! The answer:
The best written and designed ESL books must accurately ask and answer these
three main questions:

How can we get the students to like the material?

How can we get the students to understand the material?

How can we get the students to remember the material?

This book excels in all three. Through a multi-faceted approach to language
learning, each student will have a great time learning it, an easier time
comprehending it, and more effective way of retaining it. It is a
communicative, values-based, integrated-skills (listening, reading, and
speaking) approach to learning how to SPEAK the language. It is designed to
guide the teacher in presenting interesting English and then giving the
students a chance to practice and create with it.

The unique, straight -**A**- features of this book are:

**_A_** communicative, values-based, integrated skills (listening, reading, and speaking) approach to  
learning how to speak the English language and understand C.U.L.T.U.R.E.

**_A_** modern language book that teaches students how to speak contemporary English, including  
the sharpening of their listening, critical thinking, and problem-solving
skills.

_ **A**_ unique student-centered approach that is easily received, understood,
and remembered by

using a presentation, practice, and production format.

**_A_** course that will develop character and leadership qualities and improve the pronunciation and  
conversational skills of each student, making them into successful, confident
English speakers

and young, world-class business professionals and educators.

At the same time, one must remember that the secret to learning a language is
not learning a lot and practicing a little, but learning a little and
practicing a lot! Like learning how to play ping pong, one must not only watch
good players, but also pick up the paddle and start to play. _Learning a
language is more like playing a sport than studying history_. A Chinese
proverb says, “Tell me, I'll forget. Show me, I may remember. But involve me,
and I'll understand.”** **It doesn’t mean one shouldn’t be diligent in his
study; only that YOU have to DO IT to be good at it! Like learning how to play
a sport with the coach explaining, demonstrating, and then watching the
players do it, so should language be taught.

Moreover, like being an excellent athlete, the language learner must be
intrinsically motivated with constant attention to improving his skill. Be
careful, however, not to think that experience is the best teacher. Like a
coach with his team, guided experience is the best teacher. One must do the
right thing in the right way over a long period of time. This is the best
chance for success in ESL acquisition and in any field, for that matter.

Finally, as necessary for all great education (knowledge, skill, _and_
character), this book is also about how to grow in our understanding of the
basis of all successful living, in our personal or corporate life. This
foundational and primary principle on which all others build on is this
character trait called **_integrity_:**

**_Consistently making righteous choices, based on the right moral and ethical principles.  Complete or “whole” - not divided - holding firm to what you believe is right, and acting upon it. Making your behavior consistent with your beliefs, even when nobody is looking._**  
In order to meet this goal, you will find here a well-organized, guided
structure, yet, at the same time, one that allows you the freedom to have fun
with it. It consists of 26 topics with each topic divided into six sections.
They are as follows:

**_ _**  
**_The Character Corner (Part 1):_** A values-based reading section, introducing the reader to great men and women throughout world history who have proven themselves to be outstanding citizens, improving the daily lives of their countrymen and beyond. Who doesn’t want good character? This section gives the reader a chance to practice his listening, reading, and fluency skills. Exploring a highly-interesting subject, he will also have many opportunities to develop critical thinking skills through the insightful questions at the end of each section.  
Please remember, however, that all human beings are flawed. No one lives up to
the expectations of others. No one even lives up to the expectations they set
for themselves.

Many of the greatest people in history have had some of the greatest character
flaws. In this book we have tried to choose people who exhibit a high level of
character. We have tried to give examples of people who might serve as role
models. In one sense, this is an impossible task. A careful study of the lives
of these role models will reveal flaws. Each person we have presented as a
role model has failed at one time or another. This is the human condition. We
cannot find a perfect person, because perfect people do not exist in the real
world.

But this does not mean that we cannot find good role models. There really are
heroes in the world. The heroes are generally ordinary people who have
overcome great challenges. They have struggled with the same temptations and
failings as the rest of us. But they persevered. They refused to be defeated,
and in the end, they did something which made the world a better place.

Most of us will never be mentioned in the history books. But all of us have
the opportunity to influence the course of history. Every day we make choices.
These choices make us the people we are. These choices determine our
character. We will affect the lives of others. When our choices are good, we
will benefit others and make the world a better place. It is our hope to
encourage each of you to begin by thinking good thoughts. These thoughts will
lead to good words. These good thoughts and words will lead to good actions.
These actions will become habits. These habits will become our character. Our
character will be the most important legacy we leave to our descendants, and
to all of humankind. This section will help us learn from history. This is
because one thing we learn from history is that humankind doesn’t learn from
history; therefore we repeatedly make the same mistakes. Let us benefit from
the lessons of history.

**_The Character Corner (Part 2):_** A section to teach timeless truths that transform people into becoming responsible and respected citizens. This book not only will define the meaning of real integrity, but also explain how to become people of solid virtue by providing easy-to-follow action steps. There’s another Chinese proverb that says, “It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to bring up a generation of good men.” Integrating character into learning will “grow” a strong generation that will bring honor to family and country for years to come. _Speaking Beautiful English_ is about creating beautiful speakers - from the inside out. In order to achieve this we have added a **_“Living It Out”_** section that gives real-life examples of college and career men and women who have lived by these virtues and have succeeded. For further conversation practice in this section and other ones we have also included a **_“Let’s Talk About It”_** component, which allows the students to talk about what they had just learned from the traits and human interest stories._ _  
**_The Culture Corner:_** A section to teach students the importance of cultural awareness and understanding others’ cultural “grids” in both social and business interaction. We define culture as:  
**C** ommunication (shared/passed down) within  
**U **nified group of people - the  
**L** anguage,  
**T** raditions, and  
**U **nderlying beliefs and values within  
**R** elationships/behavior and the  
**E** nvironment (social institutions)  
Language is best learned within the framework of culture in order for it to be
accurately understood and effective. We call this language usage.  Also,
language reflects culture.  For example, in one language, the same word means
“thin,” “weak,” and “sickly.” This is because the people of this culture
equate thinness with weakness and lack of good health.

**_The Conversation Corner: _** A section to improve the students’ conversational skills in contemporary, everyday speech on the street, at home, in school and the workplace.  Since motivation is a major key to learning, we must design a curriculum that meets felt needs. This activity contains relevant topics based on the everyday life of a college student. It also uses other real-life dialogue from the business world. In this way the students will be able to remember more of what they learn because of it being directly applicable to their lives. There is a Chinese proverb that says, “An oil lamp becomes brighter after trimming, a truth becomes clearer after being discussed.” This corner will give much opportunity for discussion, producing greater understanding and fluency. These essential 25 communication skills are needed to improve your “serve” on the “court” of your business platform. We communicate in only four ways: _By what we do,_ h_ow we look, what we say,_ a_nd how we say it._ This section will focus on developing the latter two.  
**_The Career Corner:_** A section to teach students some fundamental principles of succeeding with colleagues and supervisors on the job. Students will learn how to work together with others in the job culture and overcome the challenges that await them in the marketplace. How will they be able to persist in reaching the zenith of their career? This section offers much proven advice from the experts in the field, including real life examples of these principles and leadership qualities necessary for successful work.  
In this section and others there are many opportunities to practice this
useful and modern language through fun and effective activities (partner work,
group work, games, music, drama, discussion, debate, and other activities). As
mentioned already, after most of the corners there are the “_Talking About
It”_ and “_Living It Out”_ sections. These real-life anecdotes and activities
act as great conversation starters, touching both the mind and heart of the
student. These essential components will help each student to use his
imagination, solidifying what he learns into long-term memory, paying heavy
attention to building fluency with functional English.

**_Connection Corner: _**A section to help the student to understand what is the most appropriate thing to say in a particular situation, for example, how to show sympathy, share one’s opinion, disagree, and get to know others better. Also, telephone etiquette, how to lead a business meeting, and how to improve one’s listening skills, are just a few of the many different and practical tips on having a great conversation with someone from _any_ culture. In this part you’ll find the most common, modern, and thorough examples of what to say in many different situations in your work or recreation. This up-to-date section will give anyone the best view of how things are said…TODAY!  
**_Construction Corner: _**This section attempts to cover some of the most basic grammar structures that one should know to be a fluent English speaker. Although the primary purpose of this book is not to focus heavily on grammar (there are already many good books written on the subject), it does help the speaker review and _remember_ the basics. In this part we have combined some of the best ESL drills and skills to help the student understand and REMEMBER some essential grammar. Here you’ll find some clear and simple explanations of some of the most difficult tenses, phrasal verbs, prepositions, etc.  
Keep in mind that the goal of language is communication. One university
student was asked why she liked studying English. She said, “Because I can
communicate with foreigners in their own language.” We talk and listen (along
with non-verbal cues) in order to share our thoughts and feelings and hear the
thoughts and feelings of others from their heart language. Effective
communication means that everyone involved will understand and be understood,
receive and be received, remember and be remembered. What, then, is the
ultimate goal of communication? Although communication involves a cognitive
process, its goal and context are primarily social. We communicate to develop
a relationship with someone through an exchange of information between the
messenger and the receiver. Even conducting business or doing research with
another person involves some level of relationship.

Relationship, or the interest in one, directly affects our motivation for
learning a language. For example, a boy who never had any desire to learn
English can suddenly become very motivated when he meets an English-speaking
girl he likes who can’t speak his language! Or a student wanting to study
abroad in France will do all he can to learn enough French to pass the
required exam and live there. Likewise, even those who haven’t met someone yet
or don’t have any particular plans will still be motivated to learn the
language(s) of (a) culture(s) they enjoy and admire.

Moreover, as we have seen, greater motivation leads to greater and more
effective language learning.  This, in turn, leads to better communication,
then relationships (social, business, etc.), and so on, until we’ve come full-
circle. The means and methods of this book help to keep these wheels of the
learning cycle moving smoothly. This cycle will not only develop better
knowledge and skill, but also character, which must go hand in hand with the
best educational experience.

Learning a foreign language within one’s own country can be a daunting task.
Many don’t have the opportunity to travel to the country where the native
language is spoken. It’s easy to become discouraged and give up, disappointing
those who want you to succeed. However, as Einstein once said, “Try not to
become a man of success, but rather, try to become a man of value.” The
authors hope this book will make it easier and more effective for those who
wish to become competent men and women equipped with a good mind _and heart_,
ready to serve and improve the lives of their families, country, and the
world.
