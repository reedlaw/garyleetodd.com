The area around Nanyang in Henan Province is rich in fossils, and especially
dinosaur eggs. The park was built at a site where eggs are excavated and
features a tunnel into strata with dinosaur eggs in place. An on-site museum
displays many eggs, most of which were found near Nanyang. It appears that
there will be more added to the park in the future. Photos by Gary L. Todd,
