Wuhan, situated where the Han River joins the Chang Jiang (Yangtse), was
originally 3 cities: Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang. I made 7 photo albums from
the fabulous collection of the Hubei Provincial Museum, but have added this
8th album of several other historic and scenic places in the city. Most of the
pictures are of historic Yellow Crane Tower, plus some from the Guiyuan Temple
built in the early Qing Dynasty. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. [http://picasa
