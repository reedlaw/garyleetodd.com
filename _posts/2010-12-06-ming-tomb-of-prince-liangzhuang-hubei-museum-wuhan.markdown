This album shows the contents of the early Ming Dynasty tomb of Zhu Zhanji,
Prince Liangzhuang (1411-1441), who lived at the time of the great Chinese
explorer Zheng He. The tomb was excavated in 2001. It is one of 7 albums I've
created for this provincial museum. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor
