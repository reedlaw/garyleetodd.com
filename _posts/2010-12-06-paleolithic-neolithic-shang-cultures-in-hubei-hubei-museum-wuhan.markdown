We start with the Paleolithic culture of Yunxian Man, although I am highly
doubtful of what anthropologists claim about early human history. Next we have
the exhibit of the Neolithic culture of Qujialing. We end with the Shang
Dynasty culture of Panlongcheng, which confirms that the Shang culture of Yin
(Anyang) of the Central Plains reached all the way south to the Yangtze
Valley. This is one of 7 albums I've created for this provincial museum.
