The Chu Culture existed in Hubei and Henan for about 800 years, during the
Zhou Dynasty, until its conquest by Qin in 223 BC. It was one of the main
states of China during the Spring & Autumn and the Warring States eras. I have
another album of Chu State bronzes from the Henan Museum in Zhengzhou. This is
one of 7 albums I've created for the Hubei Provincial Museum. Photos by Gary
