Political Parties

  * Not mentioned in Constitution
  * Developed in response to desires of people
  * 2 parties today
  * Minor parties exist, but not normally important
Democratic Party

  * Oldest of America’s two major parties
  * Was the conservative party in 19th century
  * Effectively removed conservatives by 1970s
  * Promotes liberal social programs like food stamps, cash payments to mothers, subsidized housing & medical care
  * Promotes big government & high taxes

America’s Political Parties

  * Politicians receive high salaries, excellent retirement benefits, & many other advantages
  * Congress is exempt from Social Security it forces all other people to pay for
  * Goal of most politicians of both parties is to get elected and keep getting re-elected
Principle of Federalism: American government operates at different levels

Each state has its own government

United States Economy

  * Large land mass & good climate
  * Abundant natural resources
  * Relatively small population
  * Protestant Work Ethic & an economic system which rewards hard work & thrift
  * (last point may be questioned today, but it was true in the past when America was becoming a world superpower)
Economic System:

Capitalism (free enterprise, market economy, or supply side economics)

  * Private ownership of property a fundamental right
  * Based on ideas in Adam Smith, _The Wealth of Nations_, 1776
  * In practice, a mixed economy with elements of capitalism & socialism
  * Similar to Britain (and China)
  * Underlying principle of capitalism: Entrepreneurs pursuing self-interest benefit everyone
  * Example of Bill Gates
  * Today, a _mixed economy_, with elements of capitalism & socialism
  * _Laissez-faire_ (government does not interfere in economy): 

  * Thomas Jefferson: “That government is best which governs least.”
  * Traditional American value still taught in school
  * American history has witnessed continuous growth of government and gradual loss of freedoms
American Industry

  * Much of America’s wealth is due to the fact the U.S. avoided the destruction of two world wars
  * The problem is that America continued to use factories built in the 19th century
  * Nations destroyed in WWII were able to rebuild with new, modern factories
Types of Businesses:

Proprietorships

  * Owned by individual or family
  * Owner liable (responsible) for all debts
  * Today about 17 million proprietorships
Partnerships

  * Owned by small number of people
  * Risk and profits are shared
  * Today about 16 million partnerships
  * Proprietorships & partnerships are called “small businesses”
  * Both types are popular with people who want to “be their own boss”
Corporations

  * Usually called big business
  * About 2% of all business, but 90% of all business income
  * Many investors (owners of stock)
  * Liability limited to value of stock
Role of Government in Business:

  * Almost none in 19th century (_laissez-faire_)
  * Today the government
  * - protects rights of workers
  * - protects consumers
  * - prevents monopolies
  * - fights for American industry in world market
  * In practice big business and allies in government pass laws & taxes aimed at limiting competition by small businesses
  * Example: minimum wage laws appear to try to help the poorest workers, but in fact they cost thousands of jobs of the least skilled and the young – such laws mainly buy the votes of workers who want to eliminate competition
**Principal American Holidays**  
Christmas (December 25): celebrates birth of Jesus Christ (most important
holiday)

  * Celebrating Christmas was outlawed in 17th century Massachusetts because it is not found in the Bible
  * By 19th century it was America’s most important holiday
  * America turned away from its Christian roots in the 20th century
  * Today it is illegal to celebrate Christmas on public property
  * Today “Happy Holidays” has replaced “Merry Christmas”
  * But Christmas is still the most important holiday
  * Merchants do 50% of their yearly business during the month before Christmas
  * Christmas is the time to spend money for presents, and for families to get together
  * Christians still celebrate Christmas as the birthday of Jesus
  * While it is illegal to promote Christmas on public property, it is still permissible to celebrate Christmas in churches and private homes

  * After dinner the men watch football
Fourth of July: Independence Day – celebrated on the wrong day!

Easter celebrates resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead

Very important holiday for Christians

  * As late as the 1960s Easter was celebrated in public schools and all over America

British policy toward colonies:  “Benign Neglect”

  * Colonies developed self-government & representative assemblies
  * Labor shortage contributed to freedom & resulted in almost classless society
  * In 1763 British colonists in America were proud to be part of the British Empire
  * This feeling would change very quickly
** **  
**Lecture IV.  American Revolution, 1763-1783**  
** **  
Colonial America, 1607-1775

¨  2 centuries of neglect allowed American colonies much freedom

¨  Democratic institutions slowly emerged

¨  Colonists grew increasingly critical of governors appointed by King

¨  1735: John Peter Zenger arrested for publishing article critical of
Governor of New York

¨  Zenger tried for libel

¨  Defense attorney argued his writing was true & he should be acquitted

¨  Colonial jury agreed & acquitted Zenger

¨  Established principle that truth was a sufficient defense for libel (If
it’s true, you can’t convict a person of libel.)

¨  Landmark trial in history of freedom of the press

**More Underlying Problems**  
¨  Mercantilism: the theory that colonies exist for the benefit of the mother
country

¨  Theory led to series of acts to benefit England at the expense of America

¨  British acts forbade colonies to manufacture iron, hats, & molasses because
they competed with the mother country

**Navigation Acts**  
¨  British Navigation Acts required all goods shipped to England & her
colonies to be transported in English ships

¨  Acts required all shipments to go through England first, to provide jobs
for British dockworkers & to make it easier to tax

¨  Americans resisted British laws and became proficient smugglers

**Conflicts Leading to Independence**  
¨  Threats to colonies: Spanish in Florida, Indians in the West, & French in
Canada & the West

¨  Four colonial wars resulted

¨  French & Indian War, 1754-1763, last and most important colonial war

**1763: Treaty of Paris – British Empire doubled in size**  
**Problems Resulting from French & Indian War**  
¨  Large British debts from war

¨  Problem of defending colonies from French & Indians

¨  1763: Pontiac’s Uprising – massacres on frontier

¨  British response: Proclamation of 1763 forbade colonists from going farther
west

¨  Many investors angered because they owned land west of Proclamation Line

¨  British need for new revenue led to new taxes

¨  British stationed troops in colonies for defense – seen by colonists as
threat to liberty

Sugar Act, 1764

¨  Tax on all sugar entering colonies

¨  Britain sent customs officers to collect taxes

¨  Ordered governors to enforce laws against smuggling

¨  Accused smugglers tried by judge rather than by jury

¨  British officials given power to search suspect’s house without search
warrant

Stamp Act, 1765

  * Tax on documents & printed matter
  * Radical opponents of Stamp Act organize as Sons of Liberty
  * Sons of Liberty protest; boycott British goods; riot against stamp tax collectors & destroy house of Massachusetts governor
  * “No taxation without representation”
  * Tax repealed
Boston Massacre

  * March, 1770, Boston, Massachusetts
  * Soldiers fire into crowd; kill 5
  * Sons of Liberty claims British plot to destroy colonial liberty
  * Paul Revere propaganda: p. 278
What really happened

  * Underpaid British soldiers took second job at docks
  * Colonial dockworkers angered by competition
  * Drunken crowd attacks off-duty British soldiers
  * Throw snowballs, excrement, bricks at British
  * About 200 colonists against 20 British
  * British disorganized; panicked; fired in fear
  * Paul Revere drawing pure propaganda
Very effective propaganda: we still publish that picture today

Boston Tea Party, 1773

¨  New taxes led to new protests

¨  British repealed taxes, except tax on tea

¨  Price of tea actually lowered in effort to help East India Company

¨  Tea became symbol of British “tyranny”

¨  Sons of Liberty dressed as Indians boarded 3 British vessels in Boston
Harbor & destroyed tea in protest of “tyranny”

British response to Destruction of Tea:

¨  British responded with 4 Coercive Acts

¨  Port of Boston closed until colonists pay for tea

¨  Massachusetts legislature suspended

¨  British soldiers quartered in private buildings

¨  British soldiers accused of colonial crimes to be tried by home country,
not in colony

¨  Unrelated act: Quebec Act organized Ohio River area, making it hard for New
England to expand there

¨  Colonists call all 5 acts the “Intolerable” Acts

¨  Colonists saw Acts as plot to destroy colonial liberty

¨  First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia to plan strategy: formed
first inter-colonial government

¨  Massachusetts legislature met illegally at Concord

Colonial Minutemen

¨  Opponents of British Acts organized as Minutemen

¨  Minutemen: farmers prepared to fight at a “minute’s notice”

British get tough

¨  British fired Massachusetts colonial governor

¨  Replaced governor with Army general

¨  British plan to seize colonial weapons & arrest legislature at Concord

¨  Paul Revere & others warn Minutemen

Minutemen hastily form line at Lexington: troops face each other on town
square

“Shot heard round the world”

¨  No one knows who fired the first shot

¨  British continued on to Concord: another battle

¨  Failed to find arms or colonial leaders

¨  British returned to Boston

¨  Colonial snipers harass “redcoats” all the way home; many casualties

Radicals demand independence

  * Thomas Paine: _Common Sense_, 1776
America in 1776:

  * Patriots: 1/3 favor independence
  * Loyalists: 1/3 remain loyal to England
  * Neutrals: 1/3 neutral
  * Reasons for neutrality:
  * Farmers on frontier unaffected by British policies
  * Many oppose war for religious reasons: Quaker & Anabaptist pacifists; many Christians believe they have more important mission than war
Declaration of Independence

¨  July 2, 1776: Second Continental Congress voted for Independence

¨  July 4: Thomas Jefferson’s Declaration adopted by Congress

¨  Declaration not actually signed until August

¨  Some who voted for independence were not present to sign

¨  Some signed who had not voted for independence

¨  “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure
these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish
it, and to institute a new government…”

Benjamin Franklin

¨  Inventor, scientist, newspaperman,  writer, patriot, one author of
Declaration

¨  Established first fire department & public library

¨  America’s first inter-colonial leader

¨  Never a U.S. President

**Lecture VII.  War Between the States and Reconstruction**  
Principles of History:

  * The winner of the war writes its history
  * Winners are always right
  * Winners always claim their cause is just
  * Losers are always wrong
  * Winners always make the losers look as bad as possible
  * This is true of all nations, all cultures, and all time periods of history
  * The North won the “Civil War”
  * The North wrote its history
  * The North gave the war the title “Civil War”
  * By definition, there was no “civil war” in America
  * A “civil war” is when two sides fight to control the country
  * Historically correct terms include: War Between the States; War for Southern Independence; or War of Northern Aggression
Slavery

  * Some people claim the war was about slavery
  * This is partly true, but misleading
  * Lincoln did not start the war to end slavery
  * Lincoln promised to leave slavery alone to “die a natural death”
  * Lincoln ended slavery only after he was losing & needed support of the English
  * Black African slavery has existed for over 2000 years
  * Spanish imported African slaves long before English colonies did
  * 90% of all African slaves went to Latin America & the Caribbean, not U.S.
  * Northerners from New England (not Southerners) transported all the slaves from Africa to America
  * 1619: 1st African slaves (20) in Jamestown
  * Slaves were sold at auctions
  * Slave marriages were not recognized
  * Children of slaves became slaves
  * American slavery was based on race
  * Slaves were considered property with no legal rights
  * Slaves were kidnapped in Africa by other African tribes and by Muslim slave traders, then sold to Yankee slave traders
  * Most slaves were NOT physically abused; they were valuable property
  * Average slave lived 9-10 years longer than the average free white worker in the North
  * Average slave ate 900 calories of food per day more than the average free white worker in the North
Cotton gin

  * Patented in 1793 by Eli Whitney
  * Cotton gin made slavery more profitable
  * 1 slave could now do the work of 20
  * Cotton became a valuable cash crop
  * Southern plantations began to expand as a direct result of the cotton gin
  * Slavery had been dying out before 1793
  * Afterward it began to expand
  * Southern economy became based on cotton
Southern slave-owners

  * 90% of all Southerners owned NO slaves
  * Most slave-owners owned 5 or fewer slaves
  * Fewer than 200 families owned gangs of 100 slaves or more, but these large plantation owners owned about ½ of all slaves
  * Slaves in plantation gangs lived in separate slave quarters
  * Other slaves shared the master’s house, ate with his family, and were usually considered as members of the family
Economic exploitation of the South

  * Since the 1790s Northern capitalists taxed Southern planters to finance building of Northern factories
  * 90% of all taxes were paid by the South
