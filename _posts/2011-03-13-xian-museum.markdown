The Xi'an City Museum is next to the Xiaoyan Pagoda and contains relics from
when Xi'an was the capital of the W Zhou, Qin, W Han, Sui & Tang dynasties. I
first photographed it in spring, 2011, and returned to finish the job in
October. Many bronzes and sancai photos are duplicated. I left the original
photo, followed by the more recent one. But I added hundreds of additional
photos as well. I also have 5 separate albums for the Shaanxi Provincial
Museum, which has many similar artifacts. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
