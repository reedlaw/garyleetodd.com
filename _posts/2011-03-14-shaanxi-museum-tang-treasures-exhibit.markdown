This is a special exhibit of a hoard of Tang Dynasty treasures displayed at
the Shaanxi Provincial Museum in March, 2011. I have 5 earlier albums from
this museum. Some of these artifacts can be found in my Tang Gallery album
from 2009, and may even be better photos because the harsh lighting in this
exhibit made it difficult to get good images. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â [
