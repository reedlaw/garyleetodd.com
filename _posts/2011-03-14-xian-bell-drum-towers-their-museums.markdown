The Bell & Drum Towers of Xi'an date from early Ming Dynasty, and, along with
the pair in Beijing, are the best-preserved bell & drum towers in China. Both
contain small museums, and offer musical performances at regular intervals. I
have more photos of both posted in my earlier "Xi'an: Ancient Capital" album.
