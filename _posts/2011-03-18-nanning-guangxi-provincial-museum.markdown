Nanning is in the south near the Vietnamese border. The museum is small, but
has some very rare Baiyue bronze artifacts, and has the world's largest
collection of bronze drums. I included at the end some photos of People's
Park. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International
University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â [https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/
