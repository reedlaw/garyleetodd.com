The National Museum in Beijing opened in March, 2011, after 5 years of
renovation. I have 4 albums of photos taken April 7, but the majority of the
exhibits were not yet open. This one is a permanent exhibit about China's
recovery following a century of degradation at the hands of the West. Much of
the exhibit is photographs & documents, and I omitted much. The English text I
posted is highly informative - at many levels. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D.,
Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â [
