Seven of the nine emperors of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127 AD) are
buried in and around Gongyi, along with hundreds of royal family members and
honored civil officials. Two Imperial tombs are currently protected and open
to the public; the others lie scattered among farmers' fields. I have
photographed six of the Imperial tombs, along with several lesser tombs. The
statues are part of the "spirit way" leading to each tomb. Photos by Gary L.
