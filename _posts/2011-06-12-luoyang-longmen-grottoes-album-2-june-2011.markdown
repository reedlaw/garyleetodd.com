Longmen Grottoes consists of over 100,000 Buddhist images carved in caves
during the Northern Dynasties, Sui Dynasty, & Tang Dynasty, c. 500-900 AD.
Highlight is the Grand Buddha Niche, of which the central figure represents
Maitreya, the Buddha of the Future. It was commissioned by China's only female
emperor, Wu Zetian, and supposedly is based on her physical features. I have
an earlier Longmen album with 688 photos from several previous trips. This one
was made in June, 2011, with a new Canon EOS600 digital camera. Photos by Gary
