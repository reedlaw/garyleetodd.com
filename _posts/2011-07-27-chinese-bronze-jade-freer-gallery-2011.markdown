These 2 rooms of jade & bronze in the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian in
Washington, D.C., were not here in 2009. They have such a large collection
that they rotate it. The photos I took then are posted in a separate album
labelled Chinese & Asian Art. It can be located on the website under July
2009. These artifacts were mostly acquired from China during the Warlord Era
(c. 1920s), and the bronzes were cleaned. We don't do that today with ancient
bronze, but it does give a better idea of what they looked like when they were
new. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International
University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â [https://picasaweb.google.com/GaryLeeTodd/
