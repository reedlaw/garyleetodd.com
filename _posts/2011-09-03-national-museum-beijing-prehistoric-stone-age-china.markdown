This is the 1st gallery in the Ancient China exhibit. It was not open when I
went there in the spring, so I spent September 1 & 2 taking over 1800 photos
in these eight galleries. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History,
Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â [https://picasaweb.goog
