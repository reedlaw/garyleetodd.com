This Western Han Imperial tomb is probably China's best-kept archaeological
secret. It only opened to the public a few years ago, and there is not yet
public transportation to the site. The terracotta warriors are a third the
size of the more famous ones of nearby Qin Shihuang's tomb, but here visitors
can walk over the pits and see the excavations in progress. More importantly,
this tomb doesn't have the pressing crowds of the more famous neighbor. Like
the Qin Shihuang tomb, the Han Yang tomb itself has not yet been opened.
