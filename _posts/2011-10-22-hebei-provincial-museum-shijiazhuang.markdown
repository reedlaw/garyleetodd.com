The Hebei Provincial Museum was mostly closed for renovation in late 2011 and
not scheduled to open until the end of 2012. They had but two temporary
exhibits. The first was of some first class pieces from the ancient states of
Yan and Zhao. The second was of relics collected in recent years at the site
of the construction of the great canal which will bring water to Beijing from
south of Henan. This huge construction project has uncovered thousands of
ancient artifacts spanning thousands of years. Like the Provincial Museum, the
City Museum was also closed in order to upgrade security. Photos by Gary L.
