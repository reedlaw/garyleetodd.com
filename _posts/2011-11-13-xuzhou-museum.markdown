Xuzhou City Museum has many of the treasures from two Han tombs in Xuzhou,
Jiangsu Province. I photographed the tomb and terracotta army of Liu Wu, King
of Chu, and have posted this in a separate album. The museum contains the
original jade burial suits from the tomb, as well as many other - mostly Han
Dynasty - artifacts from Xuzhou. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of
History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â [https://picas
