The first artifacts shown here were owned by Leonid Brezhnev and are currently in my possession. The photo album was presented to him by 18th Army veterans, for whom he served as political commissar during WWII. These are published here for the first time. The 63-piece ribbon bar includes his Order of Victory which he was awarded as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It was rescinded after he died in 1982, as he had obviously done nothing to earn it. Copies of the ribbon bar have appeared on eBay, but this one is genuine. Following the photo album are other Soviet artifacts in my personal collection, along with my Mao badges from the Cultural Revolution. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China. <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/116512474184071531500/LeonidBrezhnevPhotosAwardsOtherSovietMilitaria">https://picasaweb.google.com/116512474184071531500/LeonidBrezhnevPhotosAwardsOtherSovietMilitaria</a>
