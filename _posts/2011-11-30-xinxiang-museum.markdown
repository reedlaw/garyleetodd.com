Xinxiang City, which lies between Zhengzhou and Anyang, just opened this
excellent, modern museum at the end of 2011. I believe I'm the first foreigner
to visit it. Xinxiang is the site of the ancient battle of Muye, in which the
Shang Dynasty was destroyed by the Zhou, so this area is rich in Shang
artifacts. Photos by Gary L. Todd, Ph.D., Professor of History, Sias
International University, Xinzheng, Henan, China.Â [https://picasaweb.google.co
