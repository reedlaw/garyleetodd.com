Tiananmen Square lies just south of the Forbidden City. On the north end is a large portrait of Mao Zedong, who stood on that spot on October 1, 1949, and announced the birth of the People's Republic of China. On the west side is the Great Hall of the People, China's main government building. Opposite that is the National Museum. I have another album showing a temporary exhibit while the museum was undergoing renovation. Many more albums will follow when the museum reopens. On the south end is Qianmen Gate. In the square itself is the Monument to the Revolutionary Martyrs and the Mausoleum where the body of Chairman Mao lies on public display. Near the "Maosoleum" are heroic statues depicting workers, peasants, &amp; soldiers building the socialist revolution. Photos taken in 2007, 2006, and 1991. Photos by Gary L.
