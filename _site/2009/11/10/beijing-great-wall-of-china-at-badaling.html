The Great Wall of China is credited to First Emperor Qin Shihuang (221-210 BC), who actually connected various local walls built by warring states over the previous 500 years. They were originally made of rammed earth. Over 1000 km of it was rebuilt to its present condition in the Ming Dynasty, c. 1500s, in the face of a Mongol threat. Unfortunately, much of it has fallen into disrepair again. These photos were all taken at Badaling in 2011, 2009, 2006, and 1991. Photos by Gary L.
