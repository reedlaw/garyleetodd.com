<p>n  Gulf of Mexico on Southeast</p>

<p>n  50 states total</p>

<p>n  Alaska in the far north</p>

<p>n  Hawaii in middle of Pacific Ocean</p>

<p>n  Climate generally similar to that of China</p>

<p>American People: Melting Pot or Mosaic</p>

<p>n  Traditional view: America is a melting pot</p>

<p>n  An American is a new nationality</p>

<p>n  New view after 1960s: Mosaic</p>

<p>n  America made up of many different cultures</p>

<p>Class Structure</p>

<p>n  No feudal period in America</p>

<p>n  Great social mobility</p>

<p>n  Very large middle class</p>

<p>n  Relatively little poverty compared to rest of world</p>

<p>n  Largest class of poor: elderly</p>

<p>n  Most “homeless” are poor due to choices (drugs, alcohol, abandonment of family)</p>

<p>Government &amp; Politics</p>

<p>* Written Constitution, 1787, basis of law n  Main influences:</p>

<p>n  - John Locke &amp; Enlightenment</p>

<p>n  - Bible &amp; Scottish Presbyterianism</p>

<p>n  Principle: Supremacy of people and government by popular consent</p>

<p>n  Government “of the people, by the people, and for the people”</p>

<p>* Principle:  Federalism and separation of powers * Federal (National) &amp; state governments have separate &amp; distinct powers Principle of Checks &amp; Balances</p>

<p>* Government divided into 3 branches with separate &amp; distinct powers * Each branch can check the power of the other two n  America’s Founding Fathers created a Republic</p>

<p>n  They did not create a Democracy</p>

<p>n  They feared too much power in the hands of the common people</p>

<p>n  Representatives of the “better classes” were supposed to make the laws</p>

<p>n  America only became a Democracy in the 1820s</p>

<p>Three Branches of Government</p>

<p>I.  Legislative Branch (Congress)</p>

<p>* Lower House: House of Representatives * 435 total representatives * Based on population * Elected every 2 years * Congressmen must be 25 years old * Upper House:  Senate * 100 total * 2 elected from each state * Elected every 6 years * Senators must be at least 30 years old Congress makes the laws</p>

<p>Both houses must approve the laws</p>

<p>Checks &amp; Balances</p>

<p>n  House has power to impeach President or other high officials</p>

<p>n  Senate has power to conduct trial of impeached official and to convict him/her</p>

<p>Congressional Leadership</p>

<p>n  Presiding officer of House: Speaker of the House of Representatives</p>

<p>n  Speaker: leader of majority party in House</p>

<p>n  Presiding officer of Senate: Vice-President of United States (does not vote unless there is a tie)</p>

<p>n  Presiding officer of Senate in absence of VP: President <em>Pro Tempore</em>of the Senate</p>

<p>Succession if President dies</p>

<p>n  Vice President succeeds the President</p>

<p>n  Speaker of the House is next in line</p>

<p>n  President <em>Pro Tempore</em>of Senate is next</p>

<p>n  Next in succession are the members of the Cabinet, beginning with Secretary of State</p>

<p>Special Powers of the Senate</p>

<p>n  Ratifies or rejects treaties with foreign countries</p>

<p>n  Confirms or rejects important nominations by President (e.g., Cabinet members)</p>

<p>n  Conducts trials of officials impeached by House</p>

<p><strong>Lecture II.  Government, Economy and Culture</strong><br />II.  Executive Branch: President of the United States</p>

<p>* Elected for 4-year term * Can be elected only twice * Must be 35 years old * Must be natural-born U.S. citizen * Chief duty: to execute (carry out) the laws of the land * Commander in Chief of Armed Forces * Formulates and implements foreign policy (with advice &amp; consent of Congress) * Power to grant pardons &amp; amnesties * Appoints justices of Supreme Court &amp; Cabinet members (with approval of Senate) * May propose legislation * Must sign all bills before they become law * Has power to veto acts of Congress * (Congress can override veto by 2/3 majority) * President is Commander in Chief of Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, &amp; State National Guard Forces Cabinet</p>

<p>* Appointed by President with approval of Senate * Heads of 15 departments: State, Defense, Treasury, Education, Energy, Transportation, Health, etc. 1. Judicial Branch 3 levels: Federal District Courts</p>

<p>Appellate (Appeals) Courts</p>

<p>* Supreme Court: Highest court in America * 9 justices of Supreme Court * Appointed for life or good conduct Federal Courts: Original Jurisdiction</p>

<p>* Cases arising out of the Constitution * Cases related to laws &amp; treaties of U.S. * Cases involving foreign citizens &amp; governments * Cases in which federal government is a party * Normally does NOT deal with cases based on laws of individual states Judicial Review</p>

<p>* Supreme Court claims power to strike down acts of Congress it believes are unconstitutional * This power does not appear in the Constitution * Judicial Review was claimed in an 1803 court case and has never been seriously challenged Political Parties</p>

<p>* Not mentioned in Constitution * Developed in response to desires of people * 2 parties today * Minor parties exist, but not normally important Democratic Party</p>

<p>* Oldest of America’s two major parties * Was the conservative party in 19th century * Effectively removed conservatives by 1970s * Promotes liberal social programs like food stamps, cash payments to mothers, subsidized housing &amp; medical care * Promotes big government &amp; high taxes * Controls all government education (public schools &amp; universities) * Controls most of media * Claims to be party of common man but is party of Hollywood elite &amp; majority of rich * Commonly practices slander &amp; name-calling rather than reasoned debate Republican Party</p>

<p>* Formed in 1854 in crisis leading to America’s “Civil War” * Was radical/liberal party in 19th century * Became conservative party in 20th century * Traditional belief in limited government, individual responsibility, low taxes, strong national defense, tough policy against crime * Falsely labeled as party of rich, but under Reagan became popular with working people * Strong appeal to thinking people &amp; tendency to practice reasoned debate * In recent years the two parties have tended to adopt similar practices &amp; beliefs America’s Political Parties</p>

<p>* Politicians receive high salaries, excellent retirement benefits, &amp; many other advantages * Congress is exempt from Social Security it forces all other people to pay for * Goal of most politicians of both parties is to get elected and keep getting re-elected Principle of Federalism: American government operates at different levels</p>

<p>Each state has its own government</p>

<p>United States Economy</p>

<p>* Large land mass &amp; good climate * Abundant natural resources * Relatively small population * Protestant Work Ethic &amp; an economic system which rewards hard work &amp; thrift * (last point may be questioned today, but it was true in the past when America was becoming a world superpower) Economic System:</p>

<p>Capitalism (free enterprise, market economy, or supply side economics)</p>

<p>* Private ownership of property a fundamental right * Based on ideas in Adam Smith, <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, 1776 * In practice, a mixed economy with elements of capitalism &amp; socialism * Similar to Britain (and China) * Underlying principle of capitalism: Entrepreneurs pursuing self-interest benefit everyone * Example of Bill Gates * Today, a <em>mixed economy</em>, with elements of capitalism &amp; socialism * <em>Laissez-faire</em> (government does not interfere in economy):</p>

<p>* Thomas Jefferson: “That government is best which governs least.” * Traditional American value still taught in school * American history has witnessed continuous growth of government and gradual loss of freedoms American Industry</p>

<p>* Much of America’s wealth is due to the fact the U.S. avoided the destruction of two world wars * The problem is that America continued to use factories built in the 19th century * Nations destroyed in WWII were able to rebuild with new, modern factories Types of Businesses:</p>

<p>Proprietorships</p>

<p>* Owned by individual or family * Owner liable (responsible) for all debts * Today about 17 million proprietorships Partnerships</p>

<p>* Owned by small number of people * Risk and profits are shared * Today about 16 million partnerships * Proprietorships &amp; partnerships are called “small businesses” * Both types are popular with people who want to “be their own boss” Corporations</p>

<p>* Usually called big business * About 2% of all business, but 90% of all business income * Many investors (owners of stock) * Liability limited to value of stock Role of Government in Business:</p>

<p>* Almost none in 19th century (_laissez-faire_) * Today the government * - protects rights of workers * - protects consumers * - prevents monopolies * - fights for American industry in world market * In practice big business and allies in government pass laws &amp; taxes aimed at limiting competition by small businesses * Example: minimum wage laws appear to try to help the poorest workers, but in fact they cost thousands of jobs of the least skilled and the young – such laws mainly buy the votes of workers who want to eliminate competition <strong>Principal American Holidays</strong><br />Christmas (December 25): celebrates birth of Jesus Christ (most important holiday)</p>

<p>* Celebrating Christmas was outlawed in 17th century Massachusetts because it is not found in the Bible * By 19th century it was America’s most important holiday * America turned away from its Christian roots in the 20th century * Today it is illegal to celebrate Christmas on public property * Today “Happy Holidays” has replaced “Merry Christmas” * But Christmas is still the most important holiday * Merchants do 50% of their yearly business during the month before Christmas * Christmas is the time to spend money for presents, and for families to get together * Christians still celebrate Christmas as the birthday of Jesus * While it is illegal to promote Christmas on public property, it is still permissible to celebrate Christmas in churches and private homes New Year’s Day</p>

<p>* Popular day for watching American football * Extension of Christmas season * Christmas &amp; New Year’s Day together are referred to as the “holiday season” * Schools and some businesses are closed the entire week between the holidays Thanksgiving (Thursday in late November)</p>

<p>Started by Pilgrims in 1621 to give thanks to God for a bountiful harvest</p>

<p>* Christmas &amp; Thanksgiving are the two holidays Americans try to spend together with their families * Traditional Thanksgiving meal consists of turkey with stuffing, pumpkin pie, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, &amp; other fruits &amp; vegetables * After dinner the men watch football Fourth of July: Independence Day – celebrated on the wrong day!</p>

<p>Easter (Sunday in the spring)</p>

<p>Easter celebrates resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead</p>

<p>Very important holiday for Christians</p>

<p>* As late as the 1960s Easter was celebrated in public schools and all over America * Today it is officially ignored or prohibited * Christians still celebrate Easter privately * The decline of Easter reflects the growing anti-Christian attitude of the political and educational elites * Muslim holidays are beginning to be celebrated in public schools Veterans Day (November 11): honors all military veterans</p>

<p>Memorial Day (May 30): honors the dead from all wars</p>

<p>Presidents’ Day (late February): honors all U.S. presidents</p>

<p>Valentines Day, Mothers Day, Fathers Day, &amp; Halloween</p>

<p>Woodland, Prairie, Plains, Southwest, &amp; other Indian tribal groups</p>

<p>Great civilization of Maya, c. 250 BC-c. 1400 AD</p>

<p>Great civilization of Mexica (Aztec), 1325-1521</p>

<p>Norsemen in America</p>

<p>* While Maya civilization was at its height, Vikings (Norsemen) explored America * Leif Erickson established a short-lived colony in 1000AD Christopher Columbus</p>

<p>* American history traditionally begins with the 1492 “discovery” of America * He may have used maps drawn from the earlier voyages of Zheng He (1421) Effects of Columbus’ Voyages:</p>

<p>Introduction of European diseases</p>

<p>Decimation of native population by disease</p>

<p>Invasion of Spanish conquistadors</p>

<p>Conquest of great Indian civilizations: Mexica (Aztec) of Mexico &amp; Inca of Peru</p>

<p>Early America, review</p>

<p>* Many Indian cultures existed before Europeans came to America * Columbus “discovered” America, 1492 * Disease &amp; Spanish soldiers followed discovery of America * Spanish destroyed Mexica (Aztec) Empire, 1521 (and later the Incas) * Spanish Armada destroyed 1588 – paved way for English to colonize North America <strong>English colonization of America</strong><br />Jamestown, 1607</p>

<p>* Jamestown, Virginia: first permanent English colony in America * Established as trading colony * Failure &amp; starvation at first * Military discipline &amp; economic reforms saved colony * Tobacco introduced as cash crop, which led to success * Headright system gave land to settlers, 1619 * First white women sent from England as wives, 1619 * First representative assembly in America meets, 1619 (House of Burgesses) * First slaves from Africa sold at auction, 1619 * Captain John Smith saved colony from starvation * Pocahontas saved Captain Smith &amp; married John Rolfe 1620: Pilgrims came to Plymouth Plantation on <em>Mayflower</em></p>

<p>Pilgrims: Puritans who separated from Church of England</p>

<p>Pilgrims wrote <em>Mayflower Compact</em>: first self-government in America</p>

<p>Became a model as English moved west into the wilderness</p>

<p>Government was by the “consent of the governed”</p>

<p>Early example of American democracy: rule by majority</p>

<p>First Thanksgiving celebration 1621</p>

<p>Massachusetts Bay Colony (Boston), 1629</p>

<p>* Largest Puritan settlement * Governor John Winthrop: “City upon a hill” * Self-government, but only church members could participate * Most influential of all English colonies Roger Williams</p>

<p>►   Puritan minister</p>

<p>►   Disagreed with Puritan leaders of Boston</p>

<p>►   Ordered to keep opinions to himself</p>

<p>►   Expelled from Boston for religious dissent</p>

<p>Rhode Island</p>

<p>* Roger Williams expelled from Boston for religious dissent; founded Providence * Anne Hutchinson expelled from Boston for religious dissent; joined Williams * New principle: separation of church and state * Foundation for American tradition of religious freedom and tolerance Roger &amp; Anne</p>

<p>►   Williams &amp; Hutchinson both criticized leaders of Boston church &amp; state</p>

<p>►   In Rhode Island they soon quarreled with each other</p>

<p>►   Anne moved further into the wilderness</p>

<p>►   Soon the Indians killed her and her family</p>

<p>►   Many Puritans saw this as the judgment of God for her rebellious attitude</p>

<p>Salem Witch Trials, 1691</p>

<p>►   Panic in Salem, Massachusetts, when young girls began having seizures</p>

<p>►   People accused neighbors of witchcraft</p>

<p>►   Most people charged with witchcraft were innocent</p>

<p>►    19 people (and 2 dogs) sentenced to death by hanging</p>

<p>►   Giles Corey pressed to death for refusing to plead</p>

<p>►   Shows dangers of excessive religious zeal</p>

<p>►   Trials ended at insistence of ministers</p>

<p>►   Massachusetts General Court later pardoned all victims &amp; apologized</p>

<p>►   Modern research suggests a bread fungus may have caused hallucinations which colonists mistook for manifestations of demons and the Devil</p>

<p>* Believed in peace &amp; brotherly love * Believed in equality of all people * Opposed formal religious activities * Pacifists – refused to fight in any war * Refused to pay taxes for military purposes * Refused to pay taxes to support state church * Suffered persecution from state authorities * Colony welcomed all who read the Bible and believed in God * Many persecuted Germans settle in “Penn’s Woods” – bring new religious traditions * William Penn signed treaty with Indians &amp; treated them fairly Maryland</p>

<p>* George Calvert, Lord Baltimore, founder * Haven for persecuted Roman Catholics * Many Protestants also settled there * 1649 edict granted religious freedom for all Christians Other Colonies</p>

<p>* New Netherland settled by Dutch * English took over; renamed it New York * Delaware settled by Swedes; introduced log cabins to America * Connecticut founded by religious dissenters from Massachusetts * Other colonies founded for commercial purposes Georgia, the last colony of the original 13</p>

<p>* General James Oglethorpe: sought haven for debtors * Founded Georgia 1732 * Military colony as buffer against Spanish in Florida Colonial Wars in America</p>

<p>►   French &amp; Indian War ends with capture of Montreal, 1760</p>

<p>►   1763: Treaty of Paris – British empire in America doubled in size</p>

<p>British policy toward colonies:  “Benign Neglect”</p>

<p>* English generally left colonies alone – very little supervision or support * Colonies developed self-government &amp; representative assemblies * Labor shortage contributed to freedom &amp; resulted in almost classless society * In 1763 British colonists in America were proud to be part of the British Empire * This feeling would change very quickly ** **<br /><strong>Lecture IV.  American Revolution, 1763-1783</strong><br />** **<br />Colonial America, 1607-1775</p>

<p>¨  2 centuries of neglect allowed American colonies much freedom</p>

<p>¨  Democratic institutions slowly emerged</p>

<p>¨  Colonists grew increasingly critical of governors appointed by King</p>

<p>¨  1735: John Peter Zenger arrested for publishing article critical of Governor of New York</p>

<p>¨  Zenger tried for libel</p>

<p>¨  Defense attorney argued his writing was true &amp; he should be acquitted</p>

<p>¨  Colonial jury agreed &amp; acquitted Zenger</p>

<p>¨  Established principle that truth was a sufficient defense for libel (If it’s true, you can’t convict a person of libel.)</p>

<p>¨  Landmark trial in history of freedom of the press</p>

<p><strong>More Underlying Problems</strong><br />¨  Mercantilism: the theory that colonies exist for the benefit of the mother country</p>

<p>¨  Theory led to series of acts to benefit England at the expense of America</p>

<p>¨  British acts forbade colonies to manufacture iron, hats, &amp; molasses because they competed with the mother country</p>

<p><strong>Navigation Acts</strong><br />¨  British Navigation Acts required all goods shipped to England &amp; her colonies to be transported in English ships</p>

<p>¨  Acts required all shipments to go through England first, to provide jobs for British dockworkers &amp; to make it easier to tax</p>

<p>¨  Americans resisted British laws and became proficient smugglers</p>

<p><strong>Conflicts Leading to Independence</strong><br />¨  Threats to colonies: Spanish in Florida, Indians in the West, &amp; French in Canada &amp; the West</p>

<p>¨  Four colonial wars resulted</p>

<p>¨  French &amp; Indian War, 1754-1763, last and most important colonial war</p>

<p><strong>1763: Treaty of Paris – British Empire doubled in size</strong><br /><strong>Problems Resulting from French &amp; Indian War</strong><br />¨  Large British debts from war</p>

<p>¨  Problem of defending colonies from French &amp; Indians</p>

<p>¨  1763: Pontiac’s Uprising – massacres on frontier</p>

<p>¨  British response: Proclamation of 1763 forbade colonists from going farther west</p>

<p>¨  Many investors angered because they owned land west of Proclamation Line</p>

<p>¨  British need for new revenue led to new taxes</p>

<p>¨  British stationed troops in colonies for defense – seen by colonists as threat to liberty</p>

<p>Sugar Act, 1764</p>

<p>¨  Tax on all sugar entering colonies</p>

<p>¨  Britain sent customs officers to collect taxes</p>

<p>¨  Ordered governors to enforce laws against smuggling</p>

<p>¨  Accused smugglers tried by judge rather than by jury</p>

<p>¨  British officials given power to search suspect’s house without search warrant</p>

<p>Stamp Act, 1765</p>

<p>* Tax on documents &amp; printed matter * Radical opponents of Stamp Act organize as Sons of Liberty * Sons of Liberty protest; boycott British goods; riot against stamp tax collectors &amp; destroy house of Massachusetts governor * “No taxation without representation” * Tax repealed Boston Massacre</p>

<p>* March, 1770, Boston, Massachusetts * Soldiers fire into crowd; kill 5 * Sons of Liberty claims British plot to destroy colonial liberty * Paul Revere propaganda: p. 278 What really happened</p>

<p>* Underpaid British soldiers took second job at docks * Colonial dockworkers angered by competition * Drunken crowd attacks off-duty British soldiers * Throw snowballs, excrement, bricks at British * About 200 colonists against 20 British * British disorganized; panicked; fired in fear * Paul Revere drawing pure propaganda Very effective propaganda: we still publish that picture today</p>

<p>Boston Tea Party, 1773</p>

<p>¨  New taxes led to new protests</p>

<p>¨  British repealed taxes, except tax on tea</p>

<p>¨  Price of tea actually lowered in effort to help East India Company</p>

<p>¨  Tea became symbol of British “tyranny”</p>

<p>¨  Sons of Liberty dressed as Indians boarded 3 British vessels in Boston Harbor &amp; destroyed tea in protest of “tyranny”</p>

<p>British response to Destruction of Tea:</p>

<p>George Washington:</p>

<p>* Most respected man in America * Washington preserved army – saved cause of independence Battle of Yorktown, 1781</p>

<p>* Decisive battle * French fleet defeated British fleet at Virginia Capes * French &amp; Colonial armies trapped British army in Virginia * British army surrounded * French aid crucial * Lord Cornwallis surrendered to Washington Treaty of Paris, 1783</p>

<p>* British public opinion turned against war: decided war too costly * 13 colonies now free &amp; independent * Canada remained part of British Empire * Britain ceded Northwest Territory to United States due to brilliant diplomacy of Benjamin Franklin <strong>Lecture V.  Founding a New Nation: the Federalist Era</strong><br />Articles of Confederation:</p>

<p>American government during Revolution</p>

<p>* Loose union of 13 states (nations) * Weak central government * No power to tax * Any one state could veto decision of the other 12 “Critical Period”:  Problems during the Articles of Confederation period</p>

<p>* Unpaid Revolutionary War debts: government owed money to soldiers and people who provided supplies * No central money system: each state had own money or used Spanish coins * Pirate attacks on American shipping off Barbary Coast * Indian attacks on frontier: Indians killed settlers with aid of guns &amp; powder provided by British * Annapolis Convention failure, 1786 * Daniel Shays’ Rebellion, 1786 * Massachusetts took farms from people who couldn’t pay taxes * Captain Shays led revolt against tax collectors * Revolt terrified government officials Constitutional Convention, 1787</p>

<p>* 1st decision: get rid of Articles * James Madison, “father of Constitution” * Madison’s plans: * Strong central government with 3 branches: executive, legislative, judicial * System of checks &amp; balances * System of federalism with each state guaranteed republican form of government * New states admitted to union as equals James Madison: “Father of the Constitution” &amp; U.S. President</p>

<p>n  <strong>Constitution created a republic, not a democracy</strong></p>

<p>n  Founding Fathers feared too much power in hands of people</p>

<p>U. S. only became a democracy in 1820s</p>

<p>Great Compromise:</p>

<p>* Greatest challenge: representation * Large state plan: representation based on population * Small state plan: each state has equal representation * Connecticut (Great) Compromise: –        Representatives based on population</p>

<p>–        Equal number of Senators (2) per state</p>

<p>Slavery:</p>

<p>* Northern states wanted all slaves taxed Southern states did not</p>

<p>* Southern states wanted all slaves counted for purposes of representation * Northern states did not * Result: 3/5 Compromise (each slave counted as 3/5 of a person for both taxes and representation) * Slave trade to be abolished in 1808 * States required to return runaway slaves to their masters * Constitution has been called “a bundle of compromises” Ratifying the Constitution</p>

<p>* Federalists: supported Constitution * Anti-federalists: feared loss of state power &amp; individual rights * Promise of Bill of Rights (first 10 Amendments to Constitution) won over many Anti-federalists <em>Federalist Papers</em></p>

<p>n  85 letters published in New York newspapers by leading Federalists</p>

<p>n  Authors: Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, &amp; John Jay</p>

<p>n  Urged Americans to support Constitution</p>

<p>n  Regarded as best explanation of U.S. Constitution and important work on political theory</p>

<p>n  Constitution took effect 1789</p>

<p>n  Federalists kept promise and passed Bill of Rights, 1791</p>

<p>Bill of Rights:</p>

<p>* 1st Amendment: The “five freedoms” * Freedom of religion * Freedom of speech * Freedom of the press * Freedom to peacefully assemble * Freedom to petition the government to deal with complaints * 2nd Amendment: The right to keep and bear arms * Considered the basis for the freedoms of the 1st Amendment * Protection from tyranny * Government was to fear the people * 7th Amendment: Right to trial by jury * 8th Amendment: Protection from cruel and unusual punishments * 10th Amendment: All other powers not listed in Constitution belong to the States * Few Americans know 10th Amendment Constitution:</p>

<p>* Written 1787 * Ratified 1788 * In effect 1789 * Big reason for ratification was widespread trust in George Washington &amp; belief he would be first President <strong>The Federalist Era: President George Washington</strong></p>

<p>* Commanded Continental Army during War for Independence * Elected President unanimously * Served 1789-1797 * Army officers offered him chance to become king * He refused * He refused royal titles * Simply “Mr. President” * Washington did not want fame, power, or wealth * Washington did not want to be President * He wanted to peacefully retire to his farm in Virginia * But he was <em>willing</em> to serve because he knew his country needed him Washington’s Cabinet:</p>

<p>* Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson * Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton * (also Secretary of War John Knox &amp; Attorney General Edmund Randolph) Whiskey Rebellion</p>

<p>* First challenge to new government * Whiskey tax resisted in Western Pennsylvania * Washington led troops, then turned over command to Hamilton * Rebellion ended quickly as Army drew near * Leaders arrested, convicted, and later pardoned * Demonstrated power of new government Political Parties</p>

<p>n  Constitution makes no mention of political parties</p>

<p>n  Founding Fathers expected Americans to have unity</p>

<p>n  Thomas Jefferson &amp; Alexander Hamilton had very different ideas</p>

<p>n  Their followers created America’s First Party System</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p>n  Founded Democratic-Republican Party (later became today’s Democrats)</p>

<p>n  Believed in limited government: “That government is best which governs the least”</p>

<p>n  Strict construction (narrow interpretation of Constitution)</p>

<p>n  Favored farmers</p>

<p>n  Pro-French foreign policy</p>

<p>n  Opposed national bank</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton</p>

<p>n  Founded Federalist Party</p>

<p>n  Believed in strong central government</p>

<p>n  Loose construction (broad interpretation of Constitution)</p>

<p>n  Favored manufacturers</p>

<p>n  Pro-British foreign policy</p>

<p>n  Promoted national bank</p>

<p>Paying state debts from the Revolutionary War</p>

<p>* Southern states paid most of their war debts * Northern states owed much money * Hamilton wanted Federal government to pay all states’ debts * Reason: it would give credibility to new government * Southern states opposed Hamilton Compromise</p>

<p>* South agreed to paying of all state debts (benefited mostly North) * North agreed to locate national capital in South * Washington, D.C., chosen as new capital (Virginia-Maryland border) Neutrality</p>

<p>* France &amp; England at war in 1790s * Democratic-Republicans urged Washington to aid France * Federalists urged him to support England * Washington refused to take sides * Counseled policy of neutrality in foreign affairs Washington steps down</p>

<p>n  Americans wanted Washington to run for 3rd term</p>

<p>n  Washington refused</p>

<p>n  He retired after 8 years</p>

<p>n  Sets precedent (only Franklin Roosevelt violated precedent)</p>

<p>n  Said any longer in office would make a man covet the office &amp; the power</p>

<p>Washington’s Farewell Address</p>

<p>n  Published in newspapers when he retired</p>

<p>n  Said Americans should form “no entangling alliances” with European powers</p>

<p>n  Basis for American foreign policy for next century</p>

<p>Personal Assessment of President Washington</p>

<p>n  Washington could have become America’s first king</p>

<p>n  He put his country above his personal interests</p>

<p>n  He remained uncorrupted by power</p>

<p>n  For these reasons I believe Washington was possibly our greatest President</p>

<p>John Adams</p>

<p>n  Leading revolutionary</p>

<p>Undeclared Naval War with France, 1798</p>

<p>n  American &amp; French ships battle on high seas</p>

<p>n  Federalists urge Adams to declare war on France</p>

<p>n  This would have been good for Adams politically</p>

<p>n  Adams refused to go to war with France</p>

<p>n  He knew America was not ready for a war</p>

<p>n  He did what he believed was best for America, but not best for his career</p>

<p>n  Jefferson defeated Adams in the election of 1800</p>

<p><strong>Lecture VII.  War Between the States and Reconstruction</strong><br />Principles of History:</p>

<p>* The winner of the war writes its history * Winners are always right * Winners always claim their cause is just * Losers are always wrong * Winners always make the losers look as bad as possible * This is true of all nations, all cultures, and all time periods of history * The North won the “Civil War” * The North wrote its history * The North gave the war the title “Civil War” * By definition, there was no “civil war” in America * A “civil war” is when two sides fight to control the country * Historically correct terms include: War Between the States; War for Southern Independence; or War of Northern Aggression Slavery</p>

<p>* Some people claim the war was about slavery * This is partly true, but misleading * Lincoln did not start the war to end slavery * Lincoln promised to leave slavery alone to “die a natural death” * Lincoln ended slavery only after he was losing &amp; needed support of the English * Black African slavery has existed for over 2000 years * Spanish imported African slaves long before English colonies did * 90% of all African slaves went to Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, not U.S. * Northerners from New England (not Southerners) transported all the slaves from Africa to America * 1619: 1st African slaves (20) in Jamestown * Slaves were sold at auctions * Slave marriages were not recognized * Children of slaves became slaves * American slavery was based on race * Slaves were considered property with no legal rights * Slaves were kidnapped in Africa by other African tribes and by Muslim slave traders, then sold to Yankee slave traders * Most slaves were NOT physically abused; they were valuable property * Average slave lived 9-10 years longer than the average free white worker in the North * Average slave ate 900 calories of food per day more than the average free white worker in the North Cotton gin</p>

<p>* Patented in 1793 by Eli Whitney * Cotton gin made slavery more profitable * 1 slave could now do the work of 20 * Cotton became a valuable cash crop * Southern plantations began to expand as a direct result of the cotton gin * Slavery had been dying out before 1793 * Afterward it began to expand * Southern economy became based on cotton Southern slave-owners</p>

<p>* 90% of all Southerners owned NO slaves * Most slave-owners owned 5 or fewer slaves * Fewer than 200 families owned gangs of 100 slaves or more, but these large plantation owners owned about ½ of all slaves * Slaves in plantation gangs lived in separate slave quarters * Other slaves shared the master’s house, ate with his family, and were usually considered as members of the family Economic exploitation of the South</p>

<p>* Since the 1790s Northern capitalists taxed Southern planters to finance building of Northern factories * 90% of all taxes were paid by the South * Northerners received most of the benefit of taxes on Southern agriculture * Karl Marx correctly stated that a principal cause of the “Civil War” was economic oppression of the South by the North Slave &amp; Free states</p>

<p>* Free states: North; slavery outlawed * Slave states: South; slavery legal &amp; vital to economy * Equal numbers of each in Senate * Missouri Compromise, 1820: Missouri slave state; Maine free state; preserved balance in Senate &amp; prevented conflict Mexican War</p>

<p>* 1848 treaty gave northern 1/3 of Mexico to U.S.: Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Utah, &amp; more * Mexican Cession became battleground in growing struggle between free &amp; slave states Northern Strategy:</p>

<p>* North wanted to expand number of free states until ¾ of all states are free states * North would then have enough power in Senate to end slavery by Constitutional amendment * North must prevent Southern expansion Southern Response:</p>

<p>* South must expand slavery to protect itself from growing power of North * Both sides seek to expand into the western territories * China trade spurs plans for transcontinental railroad Kansas-Nebraska Act, 1854</p>

<p>* Kansas &amp; Nebraska newest territories ready to become states * Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed bill * Goal to prepare for building RR from Chicago to California * KS-NE Act opened both states to slavery on basis of “popular sovereignty” (states can vote whether to be slave or free) * Act violated Missouri Compromise – both Kansas &amp; Nebraska lie in territory forbidden to slavery under 1820 Compromise * Kansas becomes battleground: “Bleeding Kansas” * Republican Party started by people angered by Kansas-Nebraska Act <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em></p>

<p>* 1852 novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe * Published in midst of KS-NE crisis * Great success: books, stage-plays, musicals * Showed unfairness &amp; brutality of slavery * Made many Northerners angry at South * Made Southerners feel their culture was being condemned by North * Made compromise increasingly difficult Abolitionists</p>

<p>* People who wanted to abolish slavery immediately &amp; refused to compromise * Fewer than 5% of Northern population * Saw abolition as moral issue and compromise as weak &amp; immoral * Greatly exaggerated evils of slavery to stir up anti-Southern sentiment John Brown</p>

<p>* Murdered pro-slavery family of 5 during “Bleeding Kansas” * Extreme abolitionist: tried to start slave uprising * 1859 seized arsenal at Harper’s Ferry * Slaves refused to rise in rebellion * Brown captured &amp; executed * Seen as martyr in North – execution compared to death of Jesus Christ * “Martyr” image of Brown highly offensive to South * North &amp; South no longer trust each other Election of 1860</p>

<p>* Republican Party: only in North * Republicans: party of Northern capitalists * Didn’t need Southern votes to get elected * 1860 election extremely divisive * South threatened to secede if Lincoln elected Abraham Lincoln</p>

<p>►   Hated slavery and worked for its ultimate destruction</p>

<p>►   But Lincoln promised only to prevent slavery from spreading</p>

<p>►   He promised to leave it alone where it already existed</p>

<p>►   Lincoln was a moderate, not an abolitionist</p>

<p>►   Lincoln won with 39% of popular voted</p>

<p>Confederate States of America</p>

<p>* Lower South 7 states seceded by Feb 1861 * Jefferson Davis elected President of CSA, 1861-1865 * North refused to leave Ft. Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina harbor * April, 1861: South Carolina fired on Ft. Sumter * Lincoln called for volunteers to suppress “rebellion” * Upper South 6 states secede * Confederate capital moved to Richmond, Virginia Northern advantages</p>

<p>* 22 million people * South had 9 million * Over 90% of all industry * Much more territory * Most of the wealth &amp; gold * Most of Army and entire Navy (naval blockade would prove decisive) * Huge food supply Southern advantages</p>

<p>* Fighting to defend families &amp; homeland * Closer to supplies * Best generals, skilled marksmen, &amp; experienced horsemen * Fighting on familiar territory * High morale – believed in justice of cause * “King Cotton” &amp; expectation of aid from England &amp; France Northern strategy &amp; failure</p>

<p>* Anaconda Plan: naval blockade &amp; capture of Mississippi River to economically strangle the South – proved successful * Sent army to capture CSA capital Richmond, Virginia * North lost many battles around Richmond General Robert E. Lee</p>

<p>* Lincoln offered Lee command of Northern (Union) Army * Lee’s first loyalty was to his state (country) of Virginia * Great leader – as highly respected as Washington * Offered CSA rank of general – repeatedly defeated larger Union armies Manassas (Bull Run): first large battle, 1861, Southern victory</p>

<p>Emancipation Proclamation</p>

<p>* Result of Battle of Antietam * 1 ½ years after war began * Slaves freed in areas “in rebellion” – none freed where Union actually in control * Changed war goal from “preserving Union” to “freeing the slaves” * Main purpose: win English sympathy &amp; prevent England from helping South; also encourage slave revolt * No slaves actually freed by Emancipation Proclamation War Between the States</p>

<p>* Campaigned as “born again Christian” * Quickly alienated most Christians with anti-Christian policies * Generally viewed as one of least effective Presidents * 1979: Muslim fanatics took over U.S. Embassy in Iran, held Americans hostage for 444 days * Carter sent troops to rescue hostages; planes crashed in desert * Failed rescue attempt seen as symbol of failed Carter presidency President Ronald Wilson Reagan, 1981-89</p>

<p>* Elected twice in landslide victories * Americans disillusioned over failure of liberalism * Disastrous economy * Reagan cut taxes; began greatest era of peacetime prosperity * Gave Americans pride after disillusionment of 1960s &amp; 1970s * Inspired British economic reforms * Influenced worldwide turn to market economy * Opposition of Democratic Congress prevented further reform Reagan &amp; the Cold War</p>

<p>* 2000 election was very close * Votes in Florida determined outcome * Media tried to influence election * TV networks all declared Gore the winner – before the polls had closed! * Violation of ethics &amp; previous promises American media tried to promote Democratic victory</p>

<p>* CBS claimed polls closed one hour before they actually closed * This caused many voters to stay home * Heavily Republican districts were most affected * Bush won anyway * Al Gore demanded recount * Bush won recounts – all of them Gore’s attempt to steal election</p>

<p>* Al Gore still refused to concede election * Compare with 1960: Nixon confronted with clear evidence of Democratic fraud refused to demand recount because he didn’t want to cause division in America * Gore demanded additional recounts, but only in areas which favored Democrats Election taken to U.S. Supreme Court</p>

<p>* Florida Supreme Court granted Democrats illegal extension for more recounting * U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Florida must follow the law &amp; not Gore’s demands * Democrats &amp; media claimed Bush “stole the election” “The Big Lie”</p>

<p>* It is too early to make fair &amp; adequate assessment of Bush Presidency * Most sources not yet available to scholars * Most opinions based on information provided by media * Media mostly controlled by Democrats (enemies of Bush – 89% admitted they voted for Gore) Barack Obama</p>

<p>* Bad economy always favors other party * Obama elected for promise of “change” * Seen by followers as a “savior” * But a U.S. President does not have the power to save everything The remaining lectures will deal with an overview of American history, major trends, problems, analysis and interpretations, and an assessment of the first 2 ½ years of the Obama Presidency. However, at the time I am posting this study guide, I have not fully prepared the PowerPoints for those lectures/discussions. I may or may not add them to the study guide, but they will not be used on the final examination. All questions for the final will be based on what is already posted here.</p>
