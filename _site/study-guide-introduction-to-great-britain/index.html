<p>DNA tests of burials show some came from Germany, France, Switzerland, &amp; Mediterranean</p>

<p><strong>Modern theories about Stonehenge</strong><br />  First monument begun c. 3100 BC using timber</p>

<p>  C. 2600 BC: builders began replacing timber with stone</p>

<p>  C. 1600 BC: last known construction at Stonehenge</p>

<p>  No one left written records and scholars are uncertain how Stonehenge was used</p>

<p>  It was used for burials from the beginning</p>

<p>  The design has astronomical uses</p>

<p>  It may have been used for ancestor worship, healing, &amp; other religious activities</p>

<p>* Semi-legendary king * C. 5th or 6th century * Possible Roman officer or son of Roman officer * Legends may be based on local chieftain who united Britons against Anglo-Saxon invaders * Arthur fought with mighty sword named “Excalibur” * Arthur was the ideal king * Arthur founded the Knights of the Round Table <strong>Early Christianity</strong></p>

<p>* Traditionally brought to Britain by Joseph of Arimathea in 1st century * Celtic communities developed a strong Christian tradition * During next few centuries the Bishop of Rome gained more power &amp; became Pope (“Papa”) or supreme leader of Western Christendom * Celtic Christians did not recognize Pope’s authority * This will lead to later conflict <strong>England after the Romans left</strong></p>

<p>* Almost no written records for this period * Much warfare and confusion * Cities mostly abandoned * Civilization gradually died out * Christianity nearly disappeared * Latin and Celtic languages ceased – only a few words remained a permanent part of the language of England * Only roads, walls, bridges, and buildings remained * Anglo-Saxon invaders will soon transform Britain <strong>Lecture 5: Anglo-Saxon England: Beginnings of English Society, 5th – 11th Centuries</strong><br /><strong>Anglo-Saxon invasion &amp; conquest of England</strong></p>

<p>* Angles, Saxons, Jutes from Germany * 5th – 7th centuries * Fierce warriors * Pagans worshiped Germanic deities * England means “Angle Land” <strong>Anglo-Saxon influence on English language</strong></p>

<p>Pagan Anglo-Saxons soon converted to Christianity</p>

<p><strong>Reintroduction of Christianity</strong></p>

<p>* 597 – Pope in Rome sent Augustine to Canterbury * Converted Ethelbert, King of Jutes &amp; nobles * Established convents &amp; monasteries * Monks convert common people * Roman missionaries convert much of southern England * Celtic missionaries convert northern tribes, Picts &amp; Scots * Roman missionaries: Pope supreme * Celtic Christians: Local church supreme <strong>Synod of Whitby, 664 AD</strong></p>

<p>* Synod of Whitby debated the differences between Roman &amp; Celtic Christians * Roman view prevailed – England became officially Roman Catholic * Celtic Christians continued from monastery on island of Iona * Relations between Iona &amp; Canterbury remained harmonious <strong>Christian Influence on Anglo-Saxon Poetry</strong></p>

<p>* Caedmon: author of earliest datable English poetry, 730s AD * Caedmon was a peasant who guarded cattle of abbey of Whitby * One night he saw a vision of a man who told him to sing of the Creation * He composed this poem in his sleep and repeated it the next morning <strong>Caedmon’s Poem in Old English (Anglo-Saxon)</strong></p>

<p>* Nu scylun hergan hefaenricaes uard, * metudaes maecti end his modgidanc, * uerc uuldurfadur, sue he uundra gihuaes, * eci dryctin, or astelidae; * he aerist scop aelda barnum * heben til hrofe, haleg scepen. * Tha middungeard moncynnaes uard, * eci dryctin, aefter tiadae * firum foldu, frea allmectig. <strong>Caedmon’s Poem in Modern English</strong></p>

<p>* Now we must praise the guardian of the heavenly kingdom, * the powers of the Creator and his thoughts, the works of the Father of glory, * as he, the eternal Lord, * appointed the beginning of every wondrous thing; * He, the holy Lord, the Guardian of mankind, * first created for the children of men the heaven as a roof. * Then the eternal Lord, Ruler Almighty, * afterwards adorned the world, the earth, for men. <strong>Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms</strong></p>

<p>* German tribes formed separate nations * Saxons occupied southern England * Saxons became East Saxons, Middle Saxons, South Saxons, &amp; West Saxons * Angles lived in central, N. &amp; E. England * Angles formed Mercia, East Anglia, &amp; Northumbria * Tribes slowly formed 7 separate kingdoms called <em>Heptarchy:</em>East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Mercia, Northumbria, Sussex, &amp; Wessex * From c. 500-800 AD Northumbria, Mercia, &amp; Wessex controlled other 6 in turn * King Egbert of Wessex: last king to control Heptarchy – often considered first king of England * Britons were most likely enslaved * The term Briton is often synonymous with slave * By 700 AD pagan Anglo-Saxons had converted to Christianity * Monasteries became centers of religion, scholarship &amp; education * They had large libraries and schools * Religion, education, and the arts flourished in this time <strong>Classes of society</strong></p>

<p>* Thanes or nobles * Churls (ordinary free men) * Slaves * Many Britons were enslaved * Also war captives &amp; criminals * Sometimes people sold children (or themselves) into slavery to pay debts * Christianity lessened harshness of slavery <strong>Duty to one’s lord</strong></p>

<p>* Lords provided weapons, horses, &amp; feasting for their retainers * Retainers were prepared to die to protect their lord * Loyalty to one’s lord was the Anglo-Saxon’s highest honor <strong>Anglo-Saxon (English) law</strong></p>

<p>* Different classes had different standards * Penalty for killing a man varied with his class or social status * Usually it involved payment to the man’s kin, but it could involve killing the killer * If his social rank allowed, an accused might swear an oath of innocence * Sometimes the oath of an accused was not allowed * Then he would undergo “trial by ordeal,” or the Judgment of God * The Church handled the ordeals * An ordeal began with a 3-day fast * The accused was admonished to confess his guilt, before taking Catholic mass <strong>Ordeal by hot water</strong></p>

<p>* Accused must remove a stone from a pot of boiling water (or oil) * The hand was then bound up * If the wound healed after 3 days without festering, accused was cleared of charge * If not, then he was declared guilty * But his punishment was still less than if he had been caught in the act <strong>Ordeal by hot iron</strong></p>

<p>* Accused must carry one pound of hot iron for 9 feet (3 meters) * Hand was examined after 3 days * For a serious charge, weight of iron was increased to 3 pounds * For hot water ordeal, accused must plunge arm to the elbow instead of wrist * Trial by Combat probably pre-dates English law <strong>Vikings (Danes) invaded England in 9th &amp; 10th centuries</strong><br />Vikings (Danes) easily conquered Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, except Wessex</p>

<p>* Vikings destroyed the monasteries and schools * Danes began to settle in England * Vikings added Danish elements to English language * Danes controlled nearly half of England * Viking/Danish England was called the Danelaw <strong>King Alfred the Great, 849-899</strong><br />King Alfred built the first English navy</p>
